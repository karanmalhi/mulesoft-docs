Roles and permissions in Gateway Designer match those defined in Anypoint Platform. For details, see *User Roles and Permissions* in link:/anypoint-data-gateway/v/1.3.0/managing-gateways[Managing Gateways].

== Creating a New Gateway

To create a new gateway, click *Create Gateway*. The Anypoint platform takes you through the creation process via simple configuration screens, explained below.

=== Configuring Properties

The gateway creation wizard displays the *New Gateway* screen, shown below. Here you define the following parameters:

* The connection to use. You can use the drop-down menu to select from existing connections, or click *Create* to create a new connection
* A name for the gateway
* A description for the gateway (optional)
* Username and password for the gateway
* Throttling (optional)

image:newgateway-1.2.png[newgateway-1.2]

Fill in the required parameters, and select whether to use an existing connection or create a new connection.

If you check *Apply Throttling*, the wizard prompts you for the throttling parameters:

image:throttle_params-1.2.png[throttle_params-1.2]

==== Throttling

This optional setting limits the max. number of messages that an API can process per millisecond. Throttling is applied to all API calls, regardless of the source. Messages that exceed the established limit are queued for later processing. The available parameters are:

* *Delay Time in Milliseconds:* The amount of time that responses are delayed after the SLA has been exceeded
* *DelayAttempts:* Number of attempts to process the request before fully exhausted
* *Maximum Requests Per Period:* Number of requests to allow per specified time period

When configuring throttling, you can click an input field to view its brief description:

After gateway creation completes, you can <<Publishing Your Gateway>> your gateway.

The next section explains how to create a new connection for your gateway, during the process of creating a gateway.

=== Configuring a New Connection

As detailed above, when you create a new gateway you have the option to use an existing connection, or create a new connection. If you select to create a new connection, the wizard prompts you to select from the available connection types, as shown below.

image:create_conn-1.2.png[create_conn-1.2]

Click the desired connection type, then click *Next*. The wizard displays a connection parameters configuration window. The image below displays the configuration parameters for Oracle.

image:oracle.conn.param.png[oracle.conn.param]

After filling in the required parameters, click *Next*. The wizard displays a dialogue that allows you to test your connection, and also to specify whether your connection is behind a firewall.

image:configur_oracle_db-1.2.png[configur_oracle_db-1.2]

Click *Test Connection* to ensure connectivity before actually creating the connection.

If your data source is on a private network, click **<Datasource name> datasource is behind a firewall**. The wizard enables you to download *Cloud* Extender, an agent which allows communication between Data Gateway and the data source, as explained below.

=== Configuring a New Connection for a Private Network

The configuration procedure allows you to specify whether your data source is on a private network (see screenshot above). If this is the case, the wizard takes you through the process of downloading *Cloud Extender*, an agent which allows communication between Data Gateway and the data source without the need to modify your firewall. You must install Cloud Extender on a machine that resides within the private network, and which has access to the data source (valid user credentials).

You can download and install Cloud Extender during the process for configuring a new gateway, as described below.

==== Downloading Cloud Extender

When creating a new connection, you are prompted to select the connection type (for example SAP, Oracle, etc. as described above). When you select the connection type, the wizard displays the initial configuration window for your connection (see above). After filling in the parameters required in this window, the wizard allows you to select whether your data source is on a private network.

In the example below, you are configuring a connection to an Oracle data source. To specify that the MySQL server resides on a private network, click *MySQL datasource is behind a firewall*. The wizard  prompts you to complete several steps, as shown in the image below.

image:conf_privnet-1.2.png[conf_privnet-1.2]

. Select a name for your new configuration
. Use the drop-down menu to download the version of Cloud Extender appropriate for your operating system. Cloud Extender is available for Windows, OS X and Linux.
. Install Cloud Extender on your target machine. (For details, see <<Installing Cloud Extender on Your Local Machine>>.)
. The Cloud Extender installer prompts you for an authorization code. Enter the code provided by the wizard (in the image above, `5mFRE`).
. Cloud Extender automatically tests the connection to the gateway, and displays a message with the result.
+
image:test_conn_succ-1.2.png[test_conn_succ-1.2]
+
. In your Web browser, complete the wizard for the new configuration.

At this point, Cloud Extender should be running on your local machine, enabling connections to the data source.

==== Installing Cloud Extender on Your Local Machine

As described in the previous section, you download Cloud Extender during the process of configuring a new connection for a private network. This section contains installation details.

===== Cloud Extender Description

Cloud Extender is an agent that opens a connection to Data Gateway, which Data Gateway can use for subsequent communications. Cloud Extender relays data between Data Gateway and the data source within the private network. Cloud Extender needs access to the data source, that is, network connectivity and valid user credentials. The advantage of Cloud Extender is that it eliminates the need to open ports in your firewall.

Cloud Extender tunnels socket connections via SSH over HTTP, it can even handle connections that run over a proxy. It configures itself automatically — all you have to do is run it.

===== Supported Operating Systems

Cloud Extender is available for:

* Windows (7 and above)
* OS X (10.x and above)
* GNU/Linux

===== Installation Requisites

For Windows:

* Microsoft Windows 7 or later
* JAVA_HOME environment variable set to JRE/JDK home

For OS X:

* Mac OS X 10.x or later
* JAVA_HOME environment variable set to JRE/JDK home

For Linux

* JAVA_HOME environment variable set to JRE/JDK home

In all cases, to install and run the agent you need Java 7.x or later installed.

===== Installing Cloud Extender (Windows and Mac)

Install Cloud Extender according to the normal procedure installing software on your operating system. Once installed, run the application.

===== Installing Cloud Extender (Ubuntu)

To Install Cloud Extender in Red Hat use the following command 'sudo dpkg -i mule-cloud-extender_1.0.0_all.deb' and finally 'mule-cloud-extender' to run it.

===== Installing Cloud Extender (RedHat)

To Install Cloud Extender in RedHat use the following command: 'sudo rpm -ivh mule-cloud-extender-1.0.0-1.noarch.rpm' and finally 'mule-cloud-extender' to run it.

===== Running Cloud Extender

The first time it runs, Cloud Extender requests the authorization code provided by the wizard during the gateway configuration process (see above).

Enter the authorization code you were given, then click *OK*.
+
image:cloudext_auth_code-1.2.png[cloudext_auth_code-1.2]

If the agent can't reach the server, a new window is displayed asking if the agent is behind a proxy, and then asking for the proxy details.
+
image:cloud-externder-proxy1.png[proxy question]
+
image:cloud-externder-proxy2.png[proxy question]

Once the proxy is configured, the connection is retested and if it works this time around, the wizard will close on its own. This wizard only runs the first time the Cloud Extender is executed.


===== Removing Cloud Extender (Mac and Windows)

You remove Cloud Extender like any other piece of software on your machine. You can also remove the Cloud Extender _connection_ from Data Gateway itself, without the need to remove Cloud Extender from the machine where it is installed. If you do this, Data Gateway ceases to accept connections from the Cloud Extender instance installed on the machine listed in the connection. Communication with the data source on that network become lost.

For details on removing a Cloud Extender connection, see the *Cloud Extender* section in link:/anypoint-data-gateway/v/1.3.0/managing-gateways[Managing Gateways].

===== Removing Cloud Extender (Ubuntu)

To remove Cloud Extender from Ubuntu, you must run the following command: 'sudo apt-get remove mule-cloud-extender'

===== Removing Cloud Extender (RedHat)

To remove Cloud Extender from RedHat, you must run the following command: 'sudo rpm -e mule-cloud-extender'

=== Configuring a New Connection for SAP

There are a few requirements for connecting Data Gateway to SAP; these are described below.

==== SAP Libraries

When configuring a new SAP connection, you need to have the SAP library files available on your local machine. The connection configuration window prompts you to upload the libraries necessary for a SAP connection:

* SAP IDoc JCo Library (sapidoc-x.jar)
* SAP JCo Library (sapjco-x.jar)
* SAP JCo Native Library (libsapjco-x.jar)

Download these SAP libraries from the official SAP link:https://websmp109.sap-ag.de/public/connectors[download site]. You need a SAP user ID to download.

For more information on SAP libraries, refer to  link:http://help.sap.com/saphelp_nwpi711/helpdata/en/48/70792c872c1b5ae10000000a42189c/content.htm?frameset=/en/48/707c54872c1b5ae10000000a42189c/frameset.htm&current_toc=/en/b4/3f9e64bff38c4f9a19635f57eb4248/plain.htm&node_id=444&show_children=false[SAP Java Connector] in the SAP help site.

==== Required Function Module Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE

In order to deploy a gateway to an environment, function module `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE` used by Data Gateway must exist in the SAP instance. If the module is present in the SAP instance, then no action is necessary.

Depending on the specific version of SAP, the function module may be called `/BODS/RFC_READ_TABLE` or `/SAPDS/RFC_READ_TABLE`. If the SAP instance contains one of these two modules, copy it into a new module named `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE`.

If the SAP instance does not contain any of the above-listed function modules, then you must create function module `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE`. Depending on the SAP solution and/or release, it may possible to install the module in accordance with SAP Note 1752954. If this SAP note is not applicable for your specific SAP solution and/or release, then you must implement the function module from the provided SAP transport (see files `D900237.EH6` and `K900237.EH6`). See SAP Note 1802544 for a reference on how to deploy the SAP transport. If it is not possible to import the transport into the SAP instance, then create the function module manually from the provided source code (see file `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE.abap`).

Note that in all cases the `Z_AW_RFC_READ_TABLE` module must be available on all SAP instances which can be accessed by Data Gateway.

The RFC transport is link:_attachments/SAP_transport.zip[available for download].

== Publishing Your Gateway

Once you've created your gateway, it appears on the list in the *Gateways* page. To publish it to Salesforce, click the *Edit* button for the gateway, then select *Publish*.

image:publish-1.2.png[publish-1.2]

At this point, you have set up, created and published your gateway, and are ready to populate it with objects. To do this, you also use the *Edit* menu, which also allows you to stop, delete or modify a gateway. For details on these operations, see link:/anypoint-data-gateway/v/1.3.0/managing-gateways[Managing Gateways].
