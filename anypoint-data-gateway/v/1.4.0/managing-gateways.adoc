After you have link:/anypoint-data-gateway/v/1.4.0/installing-anypoint-data-gateway[installed] Data Gateway, go to the *MuleSoft* tab to access Anypoint Data Gateway Designer.

image:MS_tab-1.2.png[Data Gateway main screen]

== User Roles and Permissions

Data Gateway is part of the Anypoint Platform; it supports business groups and environments defined in Anypoint Platform profiles. The permissions to use and manage Data Gateway are inherited from the permissions stored in Anypoint Platform relative to business groups and environments.

This means that an instance of Data Gateway can be used and managed by any user that belongs to the same business group and environment as the user who created the instance of Data Gateway.

Data Gateway Designer allows you to switch between environments (such as Production, Development, etc.; see item 3 in the table <<Overview of Anypoint Data Gateway Designer>>). These environments are configured and reside in the Anypoint Platform; a user's roles and permissions in Data Gateway match the user's roles and permissions in Anypoint Plaftorm.

The table below lists role mappings between Anypoint Platform and Data Gateway.

== Left-Hand Menu

The left-hand menu (item 2 in the image  link:#ManagingGateways-image) allows you to perform several tasks, detailed in this section.

=== Gateways

Displays the screen shown <<Overview of Anypoint Data Gateway Designer>>, which allows you to create/edit or operate on gateways.

=== Connections

Allows you to create new connections, or edit existing connections.

image:connections-1.2.png[connections-1.2]

To create a new connection, click *Create Connection*.

To edit an existing connection, click the connection name. The *Update Connection* configuration dialog is displayed, allowing you to update the parameters for the desired connection.

To remove an existing connection, hover your mouse over the connection name, then click the remove icon image:remove_icon-1.2.png[remove_icon-1.2] that appears on the left.

=== Cloud Extender

Allows you to view and delete configurations for Cloud Extender, the agent for data sources that reside behind a firewall.

image:cl.ext.list.png[cl.ext.list]

Each Cloud Extender configuration allows communication between Data Gateway and a data source on a private network. Cloud Extender itself is installed on a machine within the private network. Cloud Extender configurations can only be added during the process of configuring a new data gateway; you cannot add more configurations here. This screen allows you to list or delete existing configurations.

When you delete a Cloud Extender configuration, Data Gateway will cease to accept connections from the relevant Cloud Extender agent. Communication with any data sources within the private network will be lost.

To delete a Cloud Extender configuration, hover your mouse over the right-hand side of the list as shown in the image above, then click the remove icon that appears. Data Gateway will prompt you to acknowledge the request, as shown below.

image:cl.ext.list.confirm.remove.png[cl.ext.list.confirm.remove]

For details on Cloud Extender, see the *Configuring a New Connection on a Private Network* in link:/anypoint-data-gateway/v/1.4.0/creating-and-configuring-a-gateway[Creating and Configuring a Gateway].

=== Documentation

Click to go the link:/anypoint-data-gateway[online documentation main page].

=== VPC Setup

Here you can select from the available Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) types, as well as define VPC parameters.

== Operating on a Gateway

[TIP]
This section describes how to work with existing gateways. For information on creating a new gateway, see link:/anypoint-data-gateway/v/1.4.0/creating-and-configuring-a-gateway[Creating and Configuring a Gateway].

=== Modifying a Gateway's Status

To modify the status of an existing gateway:

. Go to the gateway list in Gateway designer by clicking *Gateways* in the global left-hand menu (see image  link:#ManagingGateways-image).
. In the gateway list, locate the gateway you wish to modify, then click the *Edit* menu on the right.
+
image:modifying_gw_status-1.2.png[modifying_gw_status-1.2]
+

. Select from the available options: *Publish*, *Start*, *Delete* or *Settings*. This last option takes you to the Salesforce Settings configuration screen, described below.

=== Modifying Gateway Settings

To modify a gateway's settings (such as name and URL), click the gateway's *Edit* menu (see above), then select *Settings*. Alternatively, click the gateway in the gateway list, then click *Settings* in the left-hand menu. Gateway Designer displays the *Settings* screen for the gateway, shown below.

+
image:data-gateway-settings-menu.png[gw_settings-1.2]
+

When you're done, click *Save*.

==== Policies

You can apply a link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/rate-limiting-and-throttling[Throttling] policy to your gateway if you wish.

==== Salesforce

All of your gateways are exposed to Salesforce through a unique external data source, consuming a single Lighting Connect license.

You can access the Salesforce settings menu by clicking the *Edit* button for a particular gateway, then selecting *Publish*, or by clicking in the Salesforce item in the left nav bar.

image:publish-1.2.png[publish-1.2]

To publish your Data Gateways, do the following:

. Select the Data Gateways to be published
. Click *Save*

[NOTE]
====
In previous versions of the Data Gateway, each Gateway was mapped to a Lightning Connect license. Now, all of your Gateways are channeled through a single external data source, exposed through the OData API shown in this screen.

If you enter the settings of any individual gateway – by clicking *Edit* -> *Settings* – you will see a different URL for the endpoint that exposes it. This endpoint is not being used to sync up with Salesforce, but is still useful for connecting to other OData consumers.
====



=== Working with Objects

You can add, modify or delete objects in a gateway, and also <<copy,copy>> objects from one gateway to another.

To perform operations on objects,

To add, modify or delete objects in a gateway:

* Click the gateway in the list of gateways, or
* Click the gateway's *Edit* menu (see above), then select *Create Object*, or
* Click *Settings*, then click *Objects* in the left-hand menu

The Objects screen displays objects in the gateway. In the image below, gateway `MySQL dev` contains two objects, `gateways` and `users`.

image:add.object-1-1.2.png[add.object-1-1.2]

==== Creating a New Object

To add a new object to a gateway, click *Create Object*.

Data Gateway displays the *New Object* screen:

image:add.object-2-1.2.png[add.object-2-1.2]

In order to create an object, you need to:

. Choose the table where the object will reside.
. Specify a name for the object.
. Optionally describe the object.
. Select the fields for the object.

To select a table, you can search through the available tables list or type the full or partial name of a table in the search box. The string you type can be any part of the table, and is case insensitive.

image:add.object-3-1.2.png[add.object-3-1.2]

When you select a table, the field selector in the *Create an External Object* screen becomes populated with the table fields. Search for the desired fields using the search box. Then, select each individual field by clicking it, as shown below. To select all fields, click the empty checkbox by the *Name* column.

image:add.object-4-1.2.png[add.object-4-1.2]

The field that is assigned the primary key (`id` in the screenshot above) is marked as such by an icon. If the table does not have a primary key, you can assign one manually by hovering your mouse over the desired field, then clicking the key icon that appears next to the key name.

[NOTE]
Tables retrieved from SAP systems may display a *Description* column for some fields.

[TIP]
To toggle viewing only selected fields in a table, click the eye icon image:eye_icon-1.2.png[eye_icon-1.2] to the left of the search box.

After you have selected the table, object name and fields, click *Create Object* at bottom right of the screen.

==== Modifying an Existing Object

To modify an object in a gateway, click the object you wish to modify. Data Gateway displays the object properties screen, which allows you to modify the object.

This is the same screen used when <<Creating a New Object>>. The image below displays the configuration window for object `users` on gateway `MySQL dev`.

image:modif.object-1.2.png[Modify object]

[[copy]]
==== Copying an Object Between Gateways

Data Gateway allows you to copy an object from one gateway to another. This feature is specially useful when working with multiple environments that you wish to maintain in a similar state, such as a development and a production environment.

When copying an object, Data Gateway performs checks to ensure that the new object being created in the target gateway is valid. If the object does not exist in the target Gateway, it will be copied even if there are errors. Accessing each object with errors and fixing them is required to enable the copied object. On the other hand, if the object already exists in the target Gateway, and copying it means that the target object will have errors, Data Gateway refuses to perform the copy operation. For example, if the source object belongs to a database table that does not exist in the target gateway, or if there is a mismatch between existing fields, Data Gateway will report the errors, and will not copy the object.

To copy an object, follow these steps:

. Go to the _target_ gateway, i.e. the gateway that you wish to copy the object(s) to, and access the list of objects for the gateway. (For example, in the list of gateways, click the desired gateway, then click *Objects* in the left-hand menu).
. Click the down arrow next to *Create Object*, then select *Copy Objects From...*

image:copy_objs_menu.png[Copy Objects menu]

Data Gateway displays the *Copy Objects* screen. This screen allows you to select the _source_ gateway and object(s).

image:copy_objs_screen.png[Copy Objects screen]

[start=3]
. From the first drop-down menu, select the source environment, i.e. the environment to which your source gateway belongs. When you select a source environment, the source gateway drop-down menu (the second drop-down menu in the screen) loads a list of gateways valid for that environment, or displays a message if there are no valid gateways.
. Select a source gateway from the second drop-down menu.
. When you select a source gateway, the list of objects on the left becomes populated with the objects available on the source gateway. The number of fields in each object is displayed to the right. You can hover the mouse over an object to view a list of the fields in that object. Select the object(s) you wish to copy, then click *Copy Objects*.

If the object(s) you wish to copy already exist in the target gateway, Data Gateway prompts you to overwrite them, or to skip copying the object(s). If the copy operation completes without error, Data Gateway again displays the list of objects.

If the copy operation produces an error, Data Gateway does _not_ copy the object; instead, it displays an error message:

image:copy_error_msg.png[Object copy error message]

Click *View Details* to see what went wrong with the copy. Data Gateway displays an explanatory message like the one below.

image:error_details.png[Object copy error details]

When copying multiple objects, any error messages provide details by object and field, such as the one below.

image:copy_error_msg2.png[Object copy error message]


== Viewing Gateway Logs

To view the logs for a gateway, click the gateway in the list of gateways, then select *Logs* from the left-hand menu.

As you can see in the image below, the log for the gateway is displayed in a scrollable pane in the browser window. Using this log viewer, you can:

* Search for log entries using the search box above the log
* Select to display the last 100 (default), 200 or 500 log entries
* View entries for all log priorities (the default) or only for specific priorities such as `INFO`, `ERROR`, `WARN`, etc.
* Download the log as a text file to your local machine

To download the log, use the download button image:download_icon-1.2.png[download_icon-1.2]  at top right.
