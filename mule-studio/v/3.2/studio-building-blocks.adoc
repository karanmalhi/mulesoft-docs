[cols=",,,",options="header",]
|===
|Category |Description |Building Block Members |Configuration Details
|Endpoints |Exchange messages (and their embedded data payloads) with external parties, such as customers of a commercial website. Inbound endpoints, which are also known as Message Sources within the context of a Mule application, listen for and receive messages on various channels such as HTTP and FTP. |Ajax, File, FTP, Generic, HTTP, IMAP, JDBC, POP3, Quartz, SFTP, |link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Studio+Endpoints[Studio Endpoints]
|Scopes |Combine entities ranging from building blocks to messages to parts of data payloads so that they an be processed as a single unit by other Message Processors in the flow. |Async, Composite Source, Message Enricher, Poll, Until Successful, Subflow |link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Studio+Scopes[Studio Scopes]
|Components |Package business logic and other functionality developed for a specific Mule application. Depending on the programming or scripting language used to develop this functionality, the code is packaged in a building block that supports Groovy, Javascript, Pojo, Spring Bean, or another language. |Echo, Flow Ref, Groovy, Java, JavaScript, Logger, Python, REST, RUBY, Soap, Script |link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Studio+Components[Studio Components]
|Transformers |Enhance, translate, or otherwise change message headers or their data payloads. For example, a payload received as part of an HTTP request-response exchange pattern can be converted to JDBC format before it is passed to a database. |Append String, Body-to-Parameter-map, Byte-Array-to-Object, Byte-Array-to-Serializable, Byte-Array-to-String, Expression, File-to-Byte-Array, File-to-String, Groovy, HTTP-Response-to-Object, HTTP-Response-to-String, Java, JavaScript, JmsMessage-to-Object, Json-to-Object, Message Properties, Message-to-HTTP-Response,Object-to-Byte-Array, Object-to-HTTP-Request, Object-to-JmsMessage, Object-to-Json, Object-to-String, Object-to-XML, Python, Ruby, Script, Serializable-to-Byte-Array, String-to-Byte-Array, Transformer Ref, XSLT, XML-to-Object |link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Studio+Transformers[Studio Transformers]
|Filters |Use various criteria to select messages for further processing. For example, incomplete or invalid user credentials may be ignored, while valid credentials are passed to an LDAP server for processing. |And, Or, Not, Custom, Exception, Expression, Filer Ref, Idempotent Message, Message, Message Property, Payload, RegEx, Schema Validation, Wildcard |link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Studio+Filters[Studio Filters]
|Flow Controls |Use various criteria to route messages and data to different building blocks in your flow. For example, a filter might route customer billing information to a credit card billing web site, while the rest of the merchandise order is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment. |All, Choice, Collection Aggregator, Collection Splitter, First Successful, Message Chunk Aggregator, Message Chunk Splitter, Resequencer, Round Robin, Splitter |link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Studio+Flow+Controls[Studio Flow Controls]
|Cloud Connectors |Facilitate calls to Web service APIs |CMIS, Magento, Mongo DB, Salesforce, Twilio, Twitter |link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Studio+Cloud+Connectors[Studio Cloud Connectors]
