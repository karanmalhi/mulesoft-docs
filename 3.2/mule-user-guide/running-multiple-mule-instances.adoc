= Running Multiple Mule Instances

Install Mule for each instance you want to run. In other words, to run three instances of Mule, install it in three different locations.

== Starting Each Instance

Follow the instructions in link:/documentation-3.2/display/32X/Running+Mule+From+the+Command+Prompt[Running Mule From the Command Prompt] to start each instance.

== Caveat

Each instance consumes its own resources. This means if an application on one instance of Mule is listening on port 8899, then the other applications on the other instances must listen on different ports.
