= Persisting MMC Data to PostgreSQL

This document covers how to persist environment and transaction data to PostgreSQL databases. Follow the instructions to <<PostgreSQL Installation>>, then follow the specific instructions for <<Persisting Environment Data>> or <<Persisting Transaction Data>> persistence to set up your user, create your database, and configure your MMC instance to persist your data.

[WARNING]
Remember that *environment data and transaction data must exist in two separate databases* (regardless of whether they are on the same server or use the same platform).

*Jump to:*

* <<Persisting Environment Data>>
* <<Persisting Transaction Data>>

== Assumptions 

This document assumes that you have an understanding of the link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/setting-up-mmc[data persistence options] for environment and transaction data and that you are familiar with the basic link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/architecture-of-the-mule-management-console[Architecture of the Mule Management Console]. It also assumes that you have installed:

* *MMC Version 3.6.0*. Download it from the link:http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[customer portal] if you need to upgrade to this version.
* *a Web application server such as Tcat, Tomcat, or JBoss*. Please refer to the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/hardware-and-software-requirements[Hardware and Software Requirements] for the latest information about hardware requirements and supported application servers, Java Runtime Environments, and browsers.

For practical purposes, this document mentions Tomcat as the servlet container; however, the instructions contained here apply also to Tcat or JBoss. If you are using Tcat or JBoss, make sure to unpack the Management Console .war file in the appropriate directory. For additional information, see link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/installing-the-production-version-of-mmc[Installing the Production Version of MMC].

[NOTE]
====
In this document, `<MMC_HOME>` refers to the directory where MMC is installed.

If you are using the trial version, this directory is inside the root of the embedded Tomcat server from which MMC runs. Depending on where you placed the bundled installation, the path is similar to `<installation_root>/mmc-distribution-mule-console-bundle-3.6.0/mmc-3.6.0/apache-tomcat-7.0.52/webapps/mmc-3.6.0`.

If you are using a production installation in an application server such as Tomcat, the path should be similar to `<Tomcat root>/webapps/mmc-console-3.6.0.` For example `/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/mmc-console-3.6.0`.
====

== PostgreSQL Installation

The PostgreSQL installation outlined here is basic: the database server is installed on the local machine and listening on the default port, with security deactivated (unsecured connection to the database by the database owner).

=== Tools

* PostgreSQL 9.1.3 (http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload[Download])
* pgAdmin III (select it when installing Postgres)
* PostgresSQL driver, included with the MMC installation. See the <<Database Driver>> section for details

=== Installing the Database

The easiest way to install the database is by using the Enterprise One-Click installer, which is freely available for http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload[download].

[NOTE]
You need administrator privileges on your machine for the installation to proceed.

[TIP]
For further details, refer to the http://www.enterprisedb.com/resources-community/tutorials-quickstarts[quick Postgres tutorials for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows].

Version 9.1 installs with the following default values:

* Default port: `5432`
* Default admin user: `postgres`

Mule recommends installing one of Postgres’s GUI administration utilities, such as `phpPdAdmin` (Web-based) or `pgAdmin III`. These can be selected for installation during the Postgres installation process. In this document, we will use `pgAdmin III`.

=== Setting Up the Database Listener

Locate the file `postgresql.conf`, which is under the root directory of the Postgres installation, for example in `/opt/PostgreSQL/9.1/data` or `/opt/PostgreSQL/9.1/main`.

Open the `postgresql.conf` file for editing, then go to the "Connections and Authentication" section. Locate the line that begins with: `listen_addresses =`. If the line reads:

[source, code, linenums]
----
listen_addresses = 'localhost'
----

Then modify it to read as below.

[source, code, linenums]
----
listen_addresses = '*'
----

This will make PostgreSQL listen on all of the available interfaces.

Locate the file `pg_hba.conf`, which should be in the same data directory of the Postgres installation. In this file, find the line that begins with:` host all`. It will probably look similar to the following.

[source, code, linenums]
----
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5
----

Modify it as per below.

[source, code, linenums]
----
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0       trust
----

This ensures that Postgres accepts all attempts to connect from any host, without asking for an encrypted password. After testing the database connection, you may wish to modify this file to restrict connections according to the security needs of your site.

(For a detailed description of the `pg_hba.conf` file, see the http://developer.postgresql.org/pgdocs/postgres/auth-pg-hba-conf.html[online documentation].)

After setting up the listener, the database must be restarted. To do this, open a terminal window (Unix terminal or DOS prompt) and use the `pg_ctl` command as described below.

* To *restart* the PostgreSQL server, run: `pg_ctl restart`
* To *verify the state* of the PostgreSQL server, run: `pg_ctl status`

[TIP]
====
*Run pg_ctl on Unix*

The `pg_ctl` command can usually be run by any user on the system, but its location is not contained in users' PATH environment variable, so attempting to run it will cause the shell to return a `command not found` error. To run the command, proceed in one of two ways:

* Locate the `pg_ctl` binary on your system, and run it by specifying the full path to it. For example:
+
* Add the full path of the binary to your PATH environment variable, for example with the command:
+
Then just run `pg_ctl`.
====

When running `pg_ctl status`, you may get the following output:

[source, code, linenums]
----
pg_ctl: no database directory specified and environment variable PGDATA unset
Try "pg_ctl --help" for more information.
----

In that case, issue the command with the following options: `pg_ctl status -D <Postgres data directory>`, as shown below.

[source, code, linenums]
----
pg_ctl status -D /opt/PostgreSQL/9.1/data
----

The same is valid for the `restart` option of the `pg_ctl` command. For example, to restart the PostgreSQL server:

[source, code, linenums]
----
pg_ctl restart -D /opt/PostgreSQL/9.1/data
----

The next step is to create the database user. Follow the relevant setup instructions below, depending on whether you are setting up a database for <<Persisting Environment Data>> or <<Persisting Transaction Data>>. 

== Persisting Environment Data

To set up PostgreSQL to persist your MMC environment data, you need to complete four steps:

. Create the database user
. Create the database
. Verify the database
. Set up MMC

=== Creating the Database User

You can create a new database user, with the following parameters:

* Role name: `mmc_status`
* Password: `mmc123`

==== Using pgAdmin III

. Log in to the database server as role `postgres`: 
.. In pgAdmin III's object browser (on the right-hand pane), right-click server *PostgreSQL* on *localhost*, then select *Connect*.
. On the *Object Browser,* right-click *Login Roles*, then select *New Login Role*.
. At the *New Login Role* dialog box, type `mmc_status` in the *Role name* field.
. Go to the *Definition* tab in the dialog box, and type the password `mmc123` in both *Password* fields.
. Click *OK* to close the *New Login Role* dialog box.

=== Creating the New Database

You can create a database called `mmc_persistency_status`, owned by role `mmc_status.`

==== Using pgAdmin III:

. Using the Object Browser, navigate to *Databases* > *New Database*.
. In the dialog box, type `mmc_persistency_status` in the *Name* field.
. In the *Owner* field, select `mmc_status.`
. In the *Definition* tab, ensure that *Encoding* is set to `UTF8`.
. Click *OK* to close the New Database dialog box.

=== Verifying the New Database

Use PostgreSQL’s `psql` command-line utility to log in to database `mmc_persistency_status` as user `mmc_status`. To do this, open a terminal and run:

[source, code, linenums]
----
psql postgres -Ummc_status
----

When you run this command, `psql` should prompt for the user’s password. After typing it, you should get a prompt similar to the following:

[source, code, linenums]
----
mmc_persistency_status=#
----

This indicates that you have successfully connected to the `mmc_persistency_status` database as user `mmc_status`.

[TIP]
====
*If you can't login using the psql command*

Depending on you PostgreSQL configuration, you may get the following error when trying to connect to the database:

This probably means that PostgreSQL is configured to accept connections for the specified user only if the operating system first authenticates that user. So, for example, to connect as user `mmc_status`, you would have to create a Unix account called `mmc_status` and run `psql` from that account.

If you do not desire this configuration, check for the following line in the PostgreSQL configuration file `pg_hba.conf`:

If the line exists, modify it as per below.
====

An example of the full login command and output:

[source, code, linenums]
----
mitra:/opt/PostgreSQL/9.1/bin$ ./psql mmc_persistency_status -Ummc_status
Password for user mmc_status:
psql.bin (9.1.3)
Type "help" for help.
mmc_persistency_status=#
----

To exit psql, type `\q`, then press *Enter*.

==== Creating the Tables

On the first run, JCR automatically creates all the tables needed to store persistent MMC information. However, you have to manually create some tables that store Quartz job info; otherwise at some point the following error occurs:

[source, code, linenums]
----
ERROR: relation "qrtz_locks" does not exist
  Position: 15 [See nested exception: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "qrtz_locks" does not exist
  Position: 15]]
----

To create and insert the tables:

. Navigate to the directory `<Mule install path>/apps/mmc/webapps/mmc/WEB-INF/classes/quartz`.
. Execute the `tables_postgres.sql` script on the target database `mmc_persistency_status`. One way to do this is by running the following command:

[source, code, linenums]
----
psql -d mmc_persistency_status -Ummc_status -f tables_postgres.sql
----

If necessary, in the above command specify `<full path>/tables_postgres.sql`.

At this point, the Postgres database should be completely defined, as shown below.

=== Setting Up MMC to Use PostgreSQL for Persisting Environment Data

==== Database Driver

To check whether your MMC installation has the PostgreSQL driver installed, go to the directory `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/lib`, and look for a file called `<postgresql-<version>.jdbc<version>.jar`, for example `postgresql-9.1-901.jdbc3.jar`.

If you do not have such a file, the driver is not installed and you will need to install it. If you do have this file, you may wish to check that it is the latest version, and update it if necessary. Both actions are explained below.

===== Installing or Updating the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver

. Go to the PostgresSQL driver link:http://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html#current[download site] and download the .jar file for the latest version. For example, `postgresql-9.3-1100.jdbc41.jar`.
. Ensure that MMC is not running.
. Copy the .jar file to the directory `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/lib`.
. If the directory contains a previous version of the driver, delete it.

==== MMC Configuration

Configuring MMC to store data on a PostgreSQL databse involves two basic tasks:

* Modifying the file `web.xml` to tell MMC to use Postgres instead of its default database
* Modifying the file `mmc-postgres.properties` to set the parameters for connecting to the Postgres database

===== Modifying `web.xml`

. In the directory `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF`, locate the file `web.xml`, then open it for editing.
. Locate the `spring.profiles.active` section, shown below.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<context-param>
<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
<param-value>tracking-h2,env-derby</param-value>
</context-param>
----

. Delete the string `env-derby`, then replace it with `env-postgres`, as shown below.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<context-param>
<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
<param-value>tracking-h2,env-postgres</param-value>
</context-param>
----

. If you are also planning to <<Persisting Transaction Data>> to PostgreSQL, delete the string `tracking-h2` and replace it with `tracking-postgres`.

[TIP]
The `spring.profiles.active` section in the `web.xml` configuration file allows you to define what external databases are used for storing environment and/or tracking data. For a quick instructions for all supported database servers, see link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/configuring-mmc-for-external-databases-quick-reference[Configuring MMC for External Databases - Quick Reference].

===== Modifying `mmc-postgres.properties`

. In the directory `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/databases`, locate the file `mmc-postgres.properties`, then open it for editing.
. The table below lists the settings contained in the file. Modify the values as needed. In general, the only values that you should need to modify are `env.username`, `env.password`, `env.host`, `env.port` and `env.dbschema`.

[width="99a",cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`env.driver` |Driver to use for connecting to the database |`org.postgresql.Driver`
|`env.script` |Script to use for creating the tables in the target database |`postgres`
|`env.username` |Database user |`mmc_status`
|`env.password` |Password for the database user |`mmc123`
|`env.host` |Hostname or IP address where the database server is listening |`localhost`
|`env.port` |Port where the database server is listening |`5432`
|`env.url` |URL for connecting to the database |`jdbc:postgresql://${env.host}:${env.port}/${env.dbschema}`
|`env.dbschema` |Database to connect to |`mmc_persistency_status`
|===
. Save the file with your modifications, if any.

=== Removing Local Database Files

For the configuration changes to take effect, before launching MMC you need to delete the local database files that MMC uses by default.

In the root directory of your Web application server, locate the `mmc-data` directory (for example, `/var/lib/tomcat6/mmc-data`), then delete the `mmc-data` directory.

[NOTE]
Before you delete `mmc-data`, make a backup copy of this directory and store it in a safe location. If anything goes wrong with your new database configuration, you can use `mmc-data` to restore the old database configuration while you troubleshoot your new database config in a test environment.

At this point, MMC, is configured to store environment data on the external Postgres database that you specified.

=== Disaster Recovery of Environment Data

Out of the box, MMC stores persistent state data in the folder `mmc-data`, which is at `<Mule install path>/.mule/mmc` (if running the trial version) or `<MULE_HOME>/mmc-data` if using an application server.  If for some reason database files become corrupted, you’ll probably have to delete `mmc-data` and start from scratch, unless you have a backup copy of `mmc-data`. But having a backup copy of `mmc-data` does not cover a catastrophic failure with complete data loss on the MMC host itself, nor does it allow for an active-passive configuration for immediate recovery.

One possible solution is to backup the database to a single file, which can then be copied to another machine. If the need for immediate recovery arises, this file can be used to restore the database to its original state.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you restore MMC to a previous state, be aware of the following:

* You are restoring MMC state data. This is not related to the persistence of Business Events, which use a completely different mechanism to store data.
* Registered servers at the time of the backup are restored, which means that one of the following situations may arise:
** A server is paired to another Mule instance. In this case, “unpair” the server through MMC, then re-pair it. This can affect deployments and server groups.
** A server does not exist anymore. Unpair the server.
** Another server is using the same IP and port as the original server. Try to identify the original server’s current IP and port, then re-pair.
** A server is correctly connected, but after the backup, deployed and/or undeployed apps are not shown or are shown incorrectly. Undeploy/Redeploy as needed to eliminate the unreconciled state.
====

==== Scenario

* Database server: `PostgreSQL 9.1`
* MMC is connected to Postgres
* A database is already created. For this example the following parameters will be used:
** Role: `mmc_status` (with same permissions as the "postgres" role)
** Database name: `mmc.test`
*** Encoding: `UTF8`
*** Owner: `mmc_status`
* Tool to access database: `pgAdmin III`

==== Backing up the Database

To backup the `mmc.test` database, complete the following steps:

. Login to pgAdmin III as admin (role `postgres`).
. On the object browser on the left-hand pane, go to *Server Groups* > **PostgreSQL 9.1** > *Databases* > **mmc.test**.
. Right-click on `mmc.test`, then navigate to *Backup* > *File Options*.
. Select the following options:
* Format: `Tar`
* Encoding: `UTF8`
* Rolename: `mmc_status`
* Filename: `<Suitable name and folder>`
. Click *Backup* to create a tar archive of the database at the location you specified.

==== Restoring the Database

To restore the `mmc.test` database, complete the following steps:

. Go to the mmc-data folder (at `<Mule install path>/.mule/mmc/mmc-data`) and delete the following folders:
* `db` (if it exists)
* `repository`
* `tracking` (this is necessary to avoid generating several stacktraces related to JCR)
* you may need to also delete `workspaces/<name of your workspace>/index`
. Login into pgAdmin III as admin (role `postgres`).
. On the object browser, make sure that the database called `mmc.test` is defined.
. Make sure that all the tables that may be defined on the database are dropped.
. Right click on `mmc.test`, select *Restore*.
. On the *File Options* tab, select: +
* Filename: `<Database backup file>`
* Format: `Custom or tar`
* Rolename: `mmc_status`
. Click *Restore*.

== Persisting Transaction Data

To set up PostgreSQL to persist your MMC transaction data, you need to complete three steps:

. Create the database user
. Create the database
. Verify the database
. Set up MMC

=== Creating the Database User

You can create a user with the following parameters:

* Role name: `tracker`
* Password: `tracker`

==== Using pgAdmin III

. Log in to the database server as user `postgres`:
.. In pgAdmin III's object browser (on the right-hand pane), right-click server *PostgreSQL* on *localhost*, then select *Connect*.
. On the *Object Browser,* right-click *Login Roles*, then select *New Login Role*.
. At the *New Login Role* dialog box, type `tracker` in the *Role name* field.
. Go to the *Definition* tab in the dialog box, and type the password `tracker` in both *Password* fields.
. Click *OK* to close the *New Login Role* dialog box.

=== Creating the New Database

You can create a database called `mmc_persistency_tracking`, owned by user `tracker.`

==== Using pgAdmin III

. Using the Object Browser, navigate to *Databases* > *New Database*.
. In the dialog box, type `mmc_persistency_tracking` in the *Name* field.
. In the *Owner* field, select `tracker`
. In the *Definition* tab, ensure that *Encoding* is set to `UTF8`
. Click *OK* to close the New Database dialog box.

=== Verifying the New Database

Use PostgreSQL’s `psql` command-line utility to log in to database `mmc_persistency_tracking` as user `tracker`. To do this, open a terminal and run:

[source, code, linenums]
----
psql postgres -Utracker
----

When you run this command, `psql` should prompt for the user’s password. After typing it, you should get a prompt similar to the following:

[source, code, linenums]
----
mmc_persistency_tracking=#
----

This indicates that you have successfully connected to the `mmc_persistency_tracking` database as user `tracker`.

[TIP]
====
*If you can't login using the psql command*

Depending on you PostgreSQL configuration, you may get the following error when trying to connect to the database:

This probably means that PostgreSQL is configured to accept connections for the specified user only if the operating system first authenticates that user. So, for example, to connect as user `mmc_status`, you would have to create a Unix account called `mmc_status` and run `psql` from that account.

If you do not desire this configuration, check for the following line in the PostgreSQL configuration file `pg_hba.conf`:

If the line exists, modify it as per below.
====

An example of the full login command and output:

[source, code, linenums]
----
mitra:/opt/PostgreSQL/9.1/bin$ ./psql mmc_persistency_tracking -Utracker
Password for user tracker:
psql.bin (9.1.3)
Type "help" for help.
mmc_persistency_tracking=#
----

To exit psql, type `\q`, then press Enter.

=== Setting Up MMC to Use PostgreSQL for Persisting Transaction Data

See the section <<Database Driver>> in this document to install or verify your installation of the PostgreSQL database driver.

==== MMC Configuration

Configuring MMC to store Business Events data on a PostgreSQL databse involves two basic tasks:

* Modifying the file `web.xml` to tell MMC to use Postgres instead of its default database
* Modifying the file `tracking-persistence-postgres.properties` to set the parameters for connecting to the Postgres database

===== Modifying `web.xml`

. In the directory `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF`, locate the file `web.xml`, then open it for editing.
. Locate the `spring.profiles.active` section, shown below.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<context-param>
<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
<param-value>tracking-h2,env-derby</param-value>
</context-param>
----

. Delete the string `tracking-h2`, then replace it with `tracking-postgres`, as shown below.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<context-param>
<param-name>spring.profiles.active</param-name>
<param-value>tracking-postgres,env-derby</param-value>
</context-param>
----

. If you are also planning to <<Persisting Environment Data>> to PostgreSQL, delete the string `env-derby` and replace it with `env-postgres`.

For a quick instructions for all supported database servers, see link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/configuring-mmc-for-external-databases-quick-reference[Configuring MMC for External Databases - Quick Reference].

==== Modifying `tracking-persistence-postgres.properties`

. In the directory `<MMC_HOME>/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/databases`, locate the file `tracking-persistence-postgres.properties`, then open it for editing.
. Modify the included settings as needed, according to the table below. In general, the only values that you should need to modify are `mmc.tracking.db.username`, `mmc.tracking.db.password`, `mmc.tracking.db.host`, `mmc.tracking.db.port` and `mmc.tracking.db.dbname`.

[width="99a",cols="33a,33a,33a",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description |Default
|`mmc.tracking.db.platform` |Type of database server to connect to |`postgres`
|`mmc.tracking.db.driver` |Driver to use for connecting to the database |`org.postgresql.Driver`
|`mmc.tracking.db.host` |Hostname or IP address where the database server is listening |`localhost`
|`mmc.tracking.db.port` |Port where the database server is listening |`5432`
|`mmc.tracking.db.url` |URL for connecting to the database |`jdbc:postgresql://${mmc.tracking.db.host}:${mmc.tracking.db.port}/${mmc.tracking.db.dbname}`
|`mmc.tracking.db.username` |Database user |`tracker`
|`mmc.tracking.db.password` |Password for the database user |`tracker`
|`mmc.tracking.db.dbname` |Database to connect to |`mmc_persistency_tracking`
|`mmc.max.events.exception.details.length` |Number of characters from a Business Events exception that will be stored in the tracking database. The maximum allowed is 261120. |`8000`
|===
. Save the file with your modifications, if any.

=== Removing Local Database Files

For the configuration changes to take effect, before launching MMC you need to delete the local database files that MMC uses by default.

In the root directory of your Web application server, locate the `mmc-data` directory (for example, `/var/lib/tomcat6/mmc-data`), then delete the `mmc-data` directory.

[NOTE]
Before you delete `mmc-data`, make a backup copy of this directory and store it in a safe location. If anything goes wrong with your new database configuration, you can use `mmc-data` to restore the old database configuration while you troubleshoot your new database config in a test environment.

At this point, MMC, is configured to store tracking data on the external Postgres database that you specified.

==== Troubleshooting Tips

If you have installed the database on a remote host and experience problems, ensure that network connectivity to the database is working. Open a terminal (Unix or DOS) and run: `telnet <host> <port>`

Output should be similar to the following.

[source, code, linenums]
----
mitra:~$ telnet dbserver 5432
Trying ::1...
Connected to dbserver.
Escape character is '^]'.
----

The above output indicates a successful connection to host `dbserver` on port 5432. A “connection refused” error indicates that nothing is listening on the specified host and port. Any other output often indicates a connectivity problem, such as a firewall blocking requests to the specified port.
