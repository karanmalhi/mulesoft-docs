= Setting Up and Managing Users in MMC

This page takes you through the basics of setting up users via the Management Console. Refer to link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/managing-mmc-users-and-roles[Managing MMC Users and Roles] for information on setting user groups and assigning permissions.

====
This page describes adding and managing users via the Management Console. You can also add and manage users using LDAP, but note that once you enable authentication through LDAP, the *Users* link is no longer available in the Management Console. See link:/mule-management-console/v/3.7/setting-up-and-managing-users-via-ldap[Setting Up and Managing Users via LDAP] for more information.

. Select at least one group from the *Available Groups* list. The new user will be added to the groups you select. Keep in mind that once the user joins a group, that user has the permissions granted to that group or groups. Use the right angle bracket (*>*) to move the selected role to *Joined Groups*.
