Click the configure icon to the right of the Servers Metrics heading (in the figure below) to customize this portion of the servers details pane. You can select the particular metrics you want displayed in the chart.

The customize screen (in the figure below) shows the active metrics, which are those currently appearing in the pane. Click the red X next to a metric to remove it from the display. For example, click the X to the right of OS Swap Usage to remove it from the chart.

Depending on the chart you select, you may be queried for more information. For example, if you select the Flow Execution Time chart, you are prompted to select a flow from the pull-down list. You can also customize the display name for the chart. See the figure below.

== Chart Configuration Options

You can add the following server metrics charts. For each type of chart, the table shows the configuration you will need to specify. Since you may configure the display name for any chart type, this option is not shown in the table. In addition, you can add the server metrics chart to all servers.
