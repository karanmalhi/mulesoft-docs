== Working with the Server Configuration Files

The Files tab displays the files and folders on the server, listing the contents of the Mule installation directory. You can view and edit any text-based (non-binary) file right in the console. The figure below shows an example of the file listing for a server. The figure also shows that clicking the text-based README.txt file displays its contents.
