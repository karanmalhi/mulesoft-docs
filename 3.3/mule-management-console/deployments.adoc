**Mule 3.3.0, 3.3.1**: A Deployment request must have at least one defined target (server ID or name, or cluster ID or name), as well as at least one application or application name to be deployed, and the deployment name.

**Mule 3.3.2 and later**: You cannot create a deployment using the server names and application names. Instead, use the server or application ID.
