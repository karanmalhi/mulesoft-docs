= Understanding Mule Interaction with Exchange Patterns

This example explains how Mule interacts with well-known exchange patterns. Exchange patterns provide a set of well-defined interaction patterns between the client and server. In Mule, there are two different types of exchange patterns: one-way and request-response.

== What You Will Learn

== Prerequisites

This example requires that you run through the previous example link:#[Using Outbound Endpoints to Publish Data]. We are going to use and slightly modify the example to learn about the two different type of exchange patterns.

=== Building the Example

. Double-click on the HTTP endpoint to view its properties, and go to the Advanced tab. Here, you will see that we are currently using the request-response exchange pattern. This means that as we input data into the console, it will also get echo'd out to the browser as well as to the file.

. Change the HTTP endpoint to use the one-way exchange pattern as shown below.'

. After saving the example, you can see that the diagram has now changed (see below). In the link:#UnderstandingMuleInteractionwithExchangePatterns-RunningtheExample[next section], we will see the difference between both of these patterns.

== Running the Example

. Right-click on the flow in the project tree and select Run As... -> Mule Application.

. Next, open up a browser and go to http://localhost:8081/echo. You should see the following in your browser. Notice that since we switched the exchange pattern to use one-way, the message does not get echo'd back to the console but only to the file.

. In order to see what happens with the request-response model, go back to step 2 and change the exchange pattern to be request-response and re-run this example. You will then see the original output from the last example.

== What Just Happened?

* You sent an HTTP request via an inbound endpoint by going to http://localhost:8081/echo.
* You saw the difference in your application's behavior between using a one-way exchange pattern and a request-response exchange pattern.
