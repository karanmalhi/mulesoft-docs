= Injecting Mule Managers into Anypoint Connectors

image:/docs/plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-attachment?locale=en_GB&version=2[image,title="6-package.png"] +

DevKit can inject several Mule managers into your module via the standard injection annotation `@Inject`.

For example, to access Mule's expression manager:

[source, java, linenums]
----
@Inject
private ExpressionManager expressionManager;
----

[WARNING]
====
Remember:

* Every field requiring injection must have a public setter method. 
* The injection mechanism currently only works on fields. 
* Method parameters annotated with `@Inject` will be ignored.

The following is a list of the available objects for injection:

* MuleContext
* TransactionManager
* SeverNotificationManager
* QueueManager
* MuleConfiguration
* LifecycleManager
* ClassLoader
* ExpressionManager
* EndpointFactory
* MuleClient
* SystemExceptionHandler
* SecurityManager
* ObjectStoreManager
* WorkManager
* Registry
