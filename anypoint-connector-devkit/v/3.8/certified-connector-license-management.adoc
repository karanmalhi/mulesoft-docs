== Introduction

With *DevKit 3.8.0*, MuleSoft Certified Connector partners/developers, referred to here also as "partners", can manage their connector’s license natively with DevKit before the connector is packaged for release, ensuring only the partner's paid customers are using the connector.

Partners that have built a MuleSoft Certified Connector can give potential customers the chance to build a Mule application with their connector and test it on the Mule ESB bundled with Anypoint Studio. However, upon deploying the Mule application with the connector, customers are prompted for the partner's generated key ensuring they possess a valid license from the partner.

== Why to Use This Licensing Mechanism

Using a MuleSoft-generated key ensures only the MuleSoft partner's paid customers have complete access to the paid version of the connector. Users who would like to test out the connector before purchasing it would be able to experiment with the connector in design in Anypoint Studio and run their application in Studio's embedded Mule runtime.

== Obtaining a Key and Keystore for Your Connector

Before submitting the developed connector to MuleSoft for certification, the prospective certified connector partner must complete these steps:

. Include the following information for MuleSoft to use before generating a partner key and keystore.
.. *Vendor Name*, *Contact Email*, *Contact Message*, *Connector Name*
. Request the key and keystore from MuleSoft which are:
.. The public `.key` file that you store in the connector
.. The `.jks` master keystore is for you as the partner to generate licenses with.

== Adjusting the Connector Code and Storing the Public Key

After obtaining the key and keystore:

. The partner adjusts the connector project code by applying the `@RequiresEntitlement` annotation, and entering values for all requested attributes.
.. `name` must be the name of the connector
.. the `provider` attribute must be the part before the `.key` suffix. For example, if MuleSoft generated a vendor key “prov-name.key”, then the partner puts “prov-name” as the provider.

----
@RequiresEntitlement(name="connector-name", provider="prov-name")
public class LicensedConnector {
  ...
----

. Put the MuleSoft-provided `.key` file under `src/main/resources` or `src/main/resources/license` in the connector’s project directory.
. The partner uses the key and the keystore to produce a license file to send to the connector customer according to detailed instructions provided to you by MuleSoft.

=== Sample Partner Connector
You can download and import this link:_attachments/licSampleConnector.zip[sample connector] in Studio to see how the license management mechanism should be configured in the connector code and where the `.lic` license file should live in the project (`src/main/resources`).

== Developing a Mule Application with a Licensed Connector

For the customer to validate their working connector license, they must make their license (`.lic` file) available through either the Mule application or the Mule server, accordingly.

=== License File in the Mule Application

Once the customer has already bought a license for the connector, the `.lic` file provided to the customer by the partner/vendor can be placed either:

* under `src/main/resources` in the application (developed in Studio) or,
* under `app/classes` if the application has already been unpacked and deployed on the server.

=== License File in the Mule Server

Instead of storing the license in the application, it can be placed instead in the `conf/` folder of the Mule server.

[NOTE]
This is the recommended approach if multiple applications require the same license.

== Licensed Connector User Experience

To test the experience of the user based on 1) whether they have properly obtained and stored their license and 2) where they try to deploy their application, follow these steps:

. Download the zipped link:_attachments/licSampleConnector.zip[sample connector project]
. From the *File* menu, select *Import* to import the .zip file into the workspace.
. From the *Project* menu, click *Clean* to build the connector.
. Right-click the connector project in Package Explorer, and click *Install or Update* to install the connector in Studio.
. *Import* either a link:_attachments/noLicenseSampleApp.zip[sample application with an unlicensed connector] or a link:_attachments/okLicenseSampleApp.zip[sample application with a licensed connector].

[NOTE]
In *application design* in Studio, running the application without the necessary connector license does not produce any error or exception.

Trying to deploy this sample Mule application to *Mule ESB On-Prem* without a valid connector license causes an exception, and is logged like this:

----
Exception…
Caused by: org.mule.devkit.3.8.0.internal.lic.exception.InvalidLicenseException: License with name [license-demo.lic] not found as resource. License was not provided or its name is not the expected
----

Attempting to deploy the Mule application using the unlicensed connector to *CloudHub* fails with a status indicator:
