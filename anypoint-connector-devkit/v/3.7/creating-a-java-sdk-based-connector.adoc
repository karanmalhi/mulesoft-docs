= Creating a Java SDK-Based Connector
:keywords: devkit, java, sdk, connector

To build your own Anypoint Connector for Studio, you can use the  Anypoint Connector DevKit. In Anypoint Studio, you can add an extension module that enables you to use link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7[Anypoint Connector DevKit].

== Creating a New Java SDK-Based Connector Project

*Note*: To import an existing connector project, see link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/creating-a-java-sdk-based-connector[Importing an Existing Connector Project].

. Click *File > New*, then select *Anypoint Connector Project*:

|Field |Description
|*Maven Settings* |Click *Manually set values*, if needed, to change the Maven Group ID, Artifact ID, or the version of the connector.
|*GitHub Settings* |Click *Add GitHub information* , if needed, to link your project to a new or existing GitHub repository.
|===
. Click *Next* and choose security for your connector, and to personalize how the connector's icon appears in Anypoint Studio when users build projects using your connector:
+
image:SecurityIcon.png[SecurityIcon] +
. Click *Finish*. This generates a project containing the structure with all the required elements such as images, sample docs, and some basic tests for your connector. Refer to the DevKit documentation to build upon this initial, basic structure in link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/installing-and-testing-your-connector-in-studio[Installing and Testing Your Connector in Studio].

== Adding Native Libraries and JARs to a Connector Build

When building connectors with dependencies that cannot be bundled within the same JAR, you can instruct Anypoint Studio to prompt users to add the files to your connector.

To add native libraries and JAR files to a build:

. Add a file to trigger this feature -  the connector must have one file per configuration at this path:
+
`<root_connector_folder>src/main/resources/META-INF/<connector_name>-<configElementName>-required-libs.xml`
+
. Ensure that the *-required-libs.xml* file contains a namespace, require, and jar tags.
+
For example:
+
[source, xml, linenums]
----
<namespace xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/tooling.attributes" xmlns:mule="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core">
    <require>
       <jar name="PeopleSoft Java Object Adapter (psjoa-1.0.jar)"
fileName="psjoa(.*)\.jar" targetFolder="/lib/peoplesoft" 
targetRuntimeFolder="/plugins" className="psft.pt8.joa.IPSMessage"/>
    </require>
</namespace>
----
+
In this example, for the PeopleSoft connector, the *jar* element contains these attributes:
+
*name*: The JAR name to display in the Anypoint Studio prompt.
+
*fileName*: Filter to apply to the selected JAR to verify that it's the required one. This matches the actual file name of the JAR.
+
*targetFolder*: Folder in the project where to copy the JAR.
+
*targetRuntimeFolder*: Folder to put the runtime.
+
*className*:  Filter to apply to the JAR to verify that it's the required one. This looks for the declared class inside the selected JAR. The class name must be the full-qualified name of the class.
+
. Specifying a required libraries XML file causes Anypoint Studio to modify your configuration description so that Studio displays an option for installing libraries:
+

NOTE: If a library is not required for a particular configuration, do not create a required-libs.xml file for that configuration.

== More DevKit Actions

The plugin also provides actions in the tool bar:

image:actions.jpeg[actions]

The same actions can be accessed by right-clicking your project in the package explorer:

image:screen21.png[screen21]

Actions that are enabled when selecting the root of a DevKit project:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*Generate Tests* |Generates Functional tests cases for your connector processors.
|*Install Or Update* |Installs or updates the connector in Anypoint Studio and in your local repository.
|*Preview Documentation* |Generates Javadoc for your connector, making use of the samples included in the sample doc file.
|*Generate Sources* |Generate the sources, schemas, editors and everything required to integrate with Mule and Anypoint Studio. This can be useful if you want to debug the behavior of your connector in a Mule app.
|*Enable* / *Disable Javadoc check* |Before releasing a connector, check that your Javadocs are in order. By enabling this flag, when attempting to build, you see all the processors that are missing Javadoc comments or samples.

=== Using Your Connector

You can copy your connector into Anypoint Studio by right-clicking your project and selecting *Anypoint Connector* > *Install or Update*. To easily find it in the palette, type the name in the search box:

image:screen18.png[screen18]

=== Previewing Documentation

When you build a connector, DevKit automatically creates an HTML file that serves as a user-friendly reference for the Javadoc annotations that you have added within your code. You can preview the contents of this file without having to build the entire project. This is equivalent to running the following command from a terminal in the project folder:

[source, code, linenums]
----
mvn clean package -DskipTests javadoc:javadoc
----

=== Generating Sources

You can instruct DevKit to build your connector and generate both a .zip file and a .jar file in your project's */target* folder. Use these files to test, or use the connector in your instance of Studio or another separate instance of Studio. To generate the sources, right-click your project in the Package Explorer, then select Anypoint Connector >Generate Sources.  This is equivalent to running the following command from the command console from within the project folder:

[source, code, linenums]
----
mvn clean package -DskipTests -Ddevkit.studio.package.skip=true -Ddevkit.javadoc.check.skip=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
----

=== Disabling the Javadoc Check

DevKit enforces the requirement that you provide Javadoc documentation for every callable method in your connector. For the sake of testing a work-in-progress project, however, you may want to disable the Javadoc Check to postpone documentation until the project is complete and ready for testing.

[source, code, linenums]
----
mvn clean package -Ddevkit.javadoc.check.skip=true
----

== Adding Samples

To navigate to a sample, click a sample link while holding the *command key* pressed. If a sample exists, the sample editor opens the processor's sample.

If you enable the Javadoc check, quickfix helps you add the missing samples, which you can trigger by typing `control + space`.

image:screen24.png[screen24]

This is what a sample looks like, which is an XML file. There are a few simple templates you can use within them:

== Understanding the Generated Connector

Your Connector basically consists of a set of operations and configurable elements users populate in order to consume the API your connector was developed for.

=== Configurables

A configurable field in your connector looks like this in the DevKit view:

image:screen11_1.png[screen11_1]

Users can configure its fields in Studio when adding a configuration global element for the connector.

After you install your connector by right-clicking the connector and clicking *Anypoint Connector* > *Install or Update*, completing the prompts, and restarting Studio, users can create Mule Projects and use your connector. The steps that follow describe how a user can configure your connector per the Configurable section of your connector.

To configure:

. Drag an instance of your connector to the canvas
. Double-click the connector to open its properties editor
. Click the green plus sign next to the *Connector Configuration* field: +
image:add+global+element.jpeg[add+global+element] +
+
. Set a value for the field. The default value you configure in the connector is presented as the initial value in the connector's configuration field *My Property*:
+
image:DevKitProperty.png[DevKitProperty]

== Processors

When users configure a Mule Project created from a connector, the Operation field options correspond to the @Processor code in the connector. In the top view of the illustration, the Demo connector has as its Operation, My Processor. The lower part of the illustration shows the processor values in the connector.

image:MyProcessor.png[MyProcessor] 

In this example, a single string was configured as an input in the method for this processor. "String" displays as an input field once the operation is selected:
