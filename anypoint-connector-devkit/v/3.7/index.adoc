= Anypoint Connector DevKit
:keywords: devkit, development, features, architecture

The *MuleSoft Anypoint DevKit*, or simply *DevKit*, enables the development of MuleSoft Anypoint Connectors.

A MuleSoft connector is an extension module to the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform, with modules that ease the interconnection of third-party systems and APIs with Mule applications.

== What is a Connector?

An Anypoint connector is an extension module that eases the interaction between a Mule application and external resources, such as a databases or APIs, through REST, SOAP, or the Java SDK.

As reusable components that hide API complexity from the integration developer, custom connectors facilitate integration with SaaS and on-premise web services, applications, and data sources. Connectors built using Anypoint DevKit in Anypoint Studio, running Mule runtime environments, act as extensions of Mule Anypoint Platform.

=== Connector Architecture

Connectors operate within Mule applications, which are built up from Mule Flows, and external resources, which are the targeted resources.

image:DevKitOverviewArchitecture.png[DevKitOverviewArchitecture]

A Mule connector has two operational sides. The Mule-facing side communicates with a resource’s target-facing client side to enable content to travel between the Mule applications, and the external target-facing resource.

==== Mule-Facing Functionality

From the Mule-facing side, a connector consists of:

* *Main Java class*. Java code that you annotate with the `@Connector` attribute. See the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/annotation-reference[Annotation Reference] for information about Anypoint Connector DevKit annotations. See  link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_annotation[Java annotations] for information on how annotations work. 
* *Connector attributes*. Properties of the `@Connector` class that you annotate with the `@Configurable` attribute. 
* *Methods*. Functionality that you annotate with the `@Processor` attribute.

Additional annotations define authentication-related functionality, such as connection management. Annotations allow you to control the layout of the Anypoint Studio dialogues for the connector as well. The data model and exceptions that either raise or propagate are also Mule-facing classes.

DevKit generates a scaffold connector when you create your Anypoint Connector project in Studio. This scaffold connector includes the `@Connector` class, the `@Configurable` attributes, the `@Processor` methods, and authentication logic to build out your connector.

==== Target-Facing Functionality

The target facing or client facing side of a connector depends on the client technology that enables access to the resource. This functionality consists of a class library and one or more classes that `@Connector` classes use to access client functionality. This functionality is called the client class.

The client class in turn generally depends on other classes to actually implement calls to the targeted resource. Depending on your target, some of these classes may be generated or provided for you. For example, if you have a Java client library, or are working with a SOAP or REST services, most of the client code is implemented there. In other cases, you have to write the code yourself.

== Coding a Connector

DevKit lets you build connectors from scratch. Before creating your own connector, check the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&sortBy=name[Anypoint Exchange] for available connectors. The connectors page also lists Community open source connectors that let you contribute to the growing community of public connector development.

==== Connector Data Model

The data model for the connector consists of the objects passed into and out of the exposed operations. While many Web services accept and return XML or JSON data, a proper Mule connector must translate the data format the client uses into Java objects – either POJOs or key-value maps which represent the data objects sent to, and returned from, the target. (Returning raw XML or JSON responses to Mule is one marker for an immature, improperly implemented connector.)

==== REST Versus SOAP

REST simplifies access to HTTP using POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE calls to provide access to creating, getting, putting, and deleting information on a resource.

DevKit provides a set of annotations called `@RestCall` annotations that helps building a Connector for a RESTful API.

SOAP is a traditional means of communicating with a resource and requires a WSDL file, which is an XML file that specifies all aspects of a Java class’s structure, methods, properties, and documentation. SOAP is an industry standard with tools for governance, building, and schema information. DevKit provides a tools that helps building a connector using a WSDL file. 

==== DevKit 3.7 Example Default Connector

The following is an example of the starting `@Connector` and `@Configuration` classes that DevKit 3.7 creates:

[source, java, linenums]
----

package org.mule.modules.demojdk;

import org.mule.api.annotations.Config;

@Connector(name="demo-jdk", friendlyName="DemoJDK")
public class DemoJDKConnector {
    @Config
    ConnectorConfig config;
    /**
     * Custom processor
     *
     * {@sample.xml ../../../doc/demo-jdk-connector.xml.sample demo-jdk:greet}
     *
     * @param friend Name to be used to generate a greeting message.
     * @return A greeting message
     */
    @Processor
    public String greet(String friend) {
        /*
         * MESSAGE PROCESSOR CODE GOES HERE
         */
        return config.getGreeting() + " " + friend + ". " + config.getReply();
    }

    public ConnectorConfig getConfig() {
        return config;
    }
    public void setConfig(ConnectorConfig config) {
        this.config = config;
    }
}
----

The DevKit 3.7 `@Configuration` class is as follows:

[source, java, linenums]
----
package org.mule.modules.demojdk.config;
import org.mule.api.annotations.components.Configuration;
import org.mule.api.annotations.Configurable;
import org.mule.api.annotations.param.Default;
@Configuration(friendlyName = "Configuration")
public class ConnectorConfig {
    /**
     * Greeting message
     */
    @Configurable
    @Default("Hello")
    private String greeting;
    /**
     * Reply message
     */
    @Configurable
    @Default("How are you?")
    private String reply;
    /**
     * Set greeting message
     *
     * @param greeting the greeting message
     */
    public void setGreeting(String greeting) {
        this.greeting = greeting;
    }
    /**
     * Get greeting message
     */
    public String getGreeting() {
        return this.greeting;
    }
    /**
     * Set reply
     *
     * @param reply the reply
     */
    public void setReply(String reply) {
        this.reply = reply;
    }
    /**
     * Get reply
     */
    public String getReply() {
        return this.reply;
    }
}
----
