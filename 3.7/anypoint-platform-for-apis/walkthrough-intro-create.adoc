== Before You Begin

Note that this portion of the walkthrough requires API Creator permissions. If you don't have the necessary permissions, contact your administrator, or navigate to another part of the walkthrough.

== Get Started

Sign in to the Anypoint Platform for APIs https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[here] and select APIs.

Haven't signed up yet? Go to link:#[Signing Up for the Anypoint Platform] for information on how to sign up for a trial account or accept an invitation for an existing organization.

When you sign in as a member of the API Creator role, you land in your organization's API administration page, which may or may not have APIs in it already. This page displays all APIs and all versions of those APIs that you are authorized to see with your account. If you are directed to your organization's Developer Portal instead, contact your Organization Administrator and ask to be added to the API Creator role so that you can complete this walkthrough.

== Create an API in the Repository

Follow these steps to create a new API in the platform. This process creates an administrative command center for your API, from which you can perform many other actions in the platform.

. Click *Add new API*.

[WARNING]
Can't see that button? Contact your Organization Administrator and ask to be added to the API Creator role. Or, if you aren't interested in creating or managing APIs, you can jump to another part of the walkthrough to learn how to link:/docs/display/current/Walkthrough+Intro+Consume[Consume an API].

. Enter a *name*, *version*, and brief *description* of your API, as shown.

== Next

You've just created an administrative home for an API version. Your next steps depend on your use case: Is this page that you just created for a brand new API, or for an API that already exists? This walkthrough can take you through either scenario, so pick which one you want to follow:

*I want to design a new API from scratch.*

Great! Go ahead and click *Define API* to start your API design. Go next to link:/docs/display/current/Walkthrough+Design+New[Creating a RAML definition for a new API].

*I want to manage an existing API.*

Great! We have a sample T-Shirt Service API that you can use for this walkthrough to represent your existing API. But before you go any further, you have another decision to make. Do you want to layer a RAML definition over this existing API, or manage the API exactly as it is? 

*I want to layer a RAML definition over my existing API.*

Excellent! In that case, click *Define API* to start your RAML layer. Go next to link:/docs/display/current/Walkthrough+Design+Existing[Creating RAML for an Existing API].


 Why would I do this?
////
Layering a RAML definition over a legacy API gives you access to the API tooling offered with the Anypoint Platform for APIs: the API Console and API Notebook. RAML is an optional step for existing APIs, but can be very useful to provide robust, easy to consume documentation for application developers who want to consume your API.
////

*I want to manage my existing API as it is.*

Okay, in that case, skip the design and build phases, and move directly to link:/docs/display/current/Walkthrough+Proxy[Deploy an API Proxy].

*I want to migrate or copy an existing API Version that I already deployed in the Anypoint Platform for APIs*

Sure! You can http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Copy+of+Managing+API+Versions[export the existing API] to a .zip file and then import it into a new API Version. This is especially useful when handling an API that is deployed to several environments (typically Dev, QA, and Prod).
