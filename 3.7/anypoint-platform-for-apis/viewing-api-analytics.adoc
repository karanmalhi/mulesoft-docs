= Viewing API Analytics

Access the Analytics dashboard for your Anypoint Platform for APIs organization to get insight into how your APIs are being used and how they are performing. This page can be accessed from https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/[here] by selecting APIs then clicking Analytics.

== Assumptions

In order to access the Analytics Dashboards, you must be a member of the Organization Administrator role for your organization. Users who are API Creators or API Version Owners can access the Top 5 APIs chart on the API administration page, but cannot access the Analytics Dashboards.

== Accessing the Top 5 APIs Chart

Organization Administrators, API Creators, and API Version Owners can view a snapshot of the latest activity for your organization's five most-called APIs at the top of the API Administration page. Note that if you don't have any APIs yet in your organization, this chart will not appear.

image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/top5.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529726[image]

Once you have data to display, the Anypoint Platform rolls together all the API calls made to all versions of an API and combines them into a single line of data. Each of your top five APIs is represented by a different color.

On this chart, you can:

* Hover over the items in the legend to highlight a single API.
* Hover over a peak to view a tooltip with details about the total number of API requests received for that collection time.
* Change the zoom by clicking the links underneath the chart title. You can view data for the last hour, three hours, day, week, or month.

To toggle this chart on or off, press Command + Shift + A.

== Accessing the Analytics Dashboards

As an Organization Administrator, you have access to the Analytics Dashboards for your organization. Go to *http://anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics[anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics]* to access your Analytics Dashboards. You can also navigate to the overview dashboard by clicking the *Analytics>* link above the Top 5 APIs chart on your API Administration page.

image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/AnalyticsLink.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529596[image]

If you don't see the Analytics> link, you are not a member of the Organization Administrator role.

== Navigating the Overview Dashboard

When you access the Analytics for your organization, by default you land on your Overview Dashboard. This dashboard displays four standard charts:

* *Requests by Date*: Line chart that shows the number of requests for all APIs in your organization.
* *Requests by Location*: Map chart that shows the number of requests for each country of origin.
* *Requests by Application*: Bar chart that shows the number of requests from each of the top five registered applications. 
* *Requests by Platform*: Ring chart that shows the number of requests broken down by platform.

image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/overviewdash1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529718[image]

All four of these charts display, by default, the data for all APIs in your organization for the past day. However, you can use the filters at the top left of the page to change the date range or filter to particular APIs. Note that the time ranges displayed automatically reflect your local time zone.

image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/filters.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529708[image]

All of the charts on the Overview Dashboard are cross-filtered. This means that if you filter the data on any one of these charts, the same filter is automatically applied to the other charts on the page. Clicking on an individual application in the bar chart, for example, displays all of the requests from that application and the locations for those requests on the map. Here's how to filter data on individual charts.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Chart |How to filter data |How to clear your filter
|*Requests by Date* |Click and drag an area of the chart to filter to just that time period. Once you have the slider filter applied, you can drag the ends to the left or right to adjust them as needed. |Click outside the area of the filtered portion.
|*Requests by Location* |Click one or more countries to filter to just those results. Hover over a country for a tooltip displaying the name of the country and the total number of API requests received from that country for the selected time period. |Click the country or countries again to reset the map.
|*Requests by Application* |Click one or more application bars to filter to just those results. Hover over an application's data bar for a tooltip displaying the name of the application and the total number of requests from that application for that time period. |Click the application(s) again to reset the chart.
|*Requests by Platform* |Click one or more segments to filter to just those results. Hover over a segment for a tooltip displaying the name of the application and the total number of requests from that application for that time period. |Click the segment(s) again to reset the chart.
|===

To export the data for any of these charts, click the export icon in the chart's upper right corner.

image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/export.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529670[image]

Note that even if you have filtered data on one of the charts to show only selected data, the export icon triggers an export of a .csv file of the full data for that chart, filtered by whatever date range and API selection you have made using the filters in the upper left of the page.

== Creating Custom Charts

The Anypoint Platform for APIs allows you to create a wide variety of custom charts to display exactly the data that you wish to track for your APIs. You can display these charts on your link:#ViewingAPIAnalytics-CreatingaCustomDashboard[Custom Dashboard].

For example, you can create custom charts that show:

* Hourly transactions per second between first day of the month and today, filtered by client id, API version, or SLA tier.
* Per minute latency average in the last 24 hours, filtered by API or grouped by client geolocation.
* Number of policy violations grouped per subscribed application, then grouped by violated policy type

To create a custom chart, click the menu icon in the upper right of the page and select *Charts*.

image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/analyticsmenu-charts.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529621[image]

. On the Charts page, click *New* to create a new custom chart. You are directed to the Create Chart screen.
+
image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/createchart.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529655[image]

. Give your chart a *Title*, and, optionally, a *Description*.
. Click one of the four thumbnails on the left of your preview to select the *chart type*.
+
Available chart types:

* Line chart
* Bar chart
* Stack chart
* Ring chart
* Map chart

. Use the drop down options to select a *data source*, a *metric*, an *aggregation* (if relevant), and a *data interval* (for line charts) or *grouping dimension* (for other chart types). 
+

Available data sources:

** All APIs in your organization or a single API version
+
Available metrics:

** Requests
** Response size
** Request size
** Response time
+
Available data intervals:

** Minutes
** Hours
** Days
+
Available grouping dimensions:

** API Name
** SLA Tier
** API Version
** Hardware Platform
** OS Family
** OS Major Version
** OS Minor Version
** OS Version
** Browser
** User Agent Version
** Application
** Client IP
** City
** Continent
** Country
** Postal Code
** Timezone
** Resource Path
** Request Timestamp
** Response Timestamp
** Status Code
** User Agent Type
** Verb
** Violated Policy Name
+
If you chose to make a *Stack chart*, you must group your data in two different dimensions. The first defines the distinct columns, the second defines the stacks within these columns. The same options are available on the second grouping dimension as on the first.
+

. Click *Save Chart* when finished.

You are redirected back to your Charts list, where you should now see the custom chart that you have created listed. Note that only you can see the custom charts that you create – these are not shared with other members of the Organization Administrator role.

See the next section for information about how to add charts to your Custom Dashboard.

=== Example Custom Chart: Policy Violations Per Application

. Name your chart *Policy Violations Per Application*
. Select a *Stack* chart for its type
+
image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/create+chart+1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416408652623[image]

. Keep the fields *Data Source* and *Metric* on their default values.
. Since this is a stack chart, there are two levels of grouping that must be selected: the first defines the columns, the second defines the stacks within these columns. In the first grouping pick Application, to display each application in a different column; in the second grouping pick Violated Policy Name to tack these in each column.
+

== Creating a Custom Dashboard

Once you have created some custom charts, you can display them side by side on a custom dashboard that is unique to you. Any other members of the Organization Administrator role do not share your custom charts or custom dashboard – these views are unique to each user.

To access your custom dashboard, click the menu icon in the upper right of the page and select *Custom Dashboard*.

image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/analyticsmenu-custom.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529636[image]

. The first time you open your custom dashboard, it will be blank. Click *Edit Dashboard* in the upper right.
. Drag and drop charts from the drawer on the left of the screen onto your dashboard, rearranging them as needed into the order that you want.
. If you don't have any charts yet, click *Create Chart* to link:#ViewingAPIAnalytics-CreatingCustomCharts[create a custom chart].
. After you add a chart to your dashboard, you have the option to open it for editing or click the X to remove it from your dashboard.
. Once you are satisfied with your custom dashboard, click *Save* at the top next to the name. You are redirected to a view of your saved custom dashboard.

image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/Custom+Dashboard.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529662[image]

When you view your custom dashboard, note that you have a date range picker in the upper left corner that allows you to adjust the time period for all the charts on your dashboard.

== Exporting Analytics Data

You can export your analytics data from the charts displayed on your Overview Dashboard or your Custom Dashboard. On either dashboard, click the export icon to download a .csv file with the data for that chart.

image:/docs/download/attachments/122752430/exporticon.png?version=1&modificationDate=1416331529689[image]

Note that the data that you download reflects the selection of the filtering options offered in the upper left corner of your dashboard. However, if you are exporting chart data from the Overview Dashboard and you have selected one or more subsections of a chart, the export files do not reflect that selection – instead any export always contains the full data for that chart without considering the chart-level filters that you may have applied.
