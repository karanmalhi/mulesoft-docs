This page provides details on the process components you configure for BPM. Some of this information is pulled directly from `mule-bpm.xsd` and is cached. For more information on BPM, see link:/docs/display/current/BPM+Module+Reference[BPM Module Reference]. Information on jBPM is available at http://www.jbpm.org.
