= Preparing a gitignore File

[NOTE]
This page describes a feature that is currently available using *Mule Studio (December 2013)* or newer.  Download and launch the http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-open-source-esb[latest version of Anypoint Studio] to take advantage of this feature.

As a part of a team of developers, you may be using a source code management (SCM) tool such as **http://git-scm.com/[git] **to keep track of changes in an application. Studio supports the use of git by presenting an option to prepare a standard ` gitignore ` file for a new Mule Project.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes familiarity with http://git-scm.com/[git] as a software version control system, and that you are using link:/docs/display/current/First+30+Minutes+with+Mule[Mule Studio] to build a new application that you intend to manage using git.

== Configuring a gitignore File

A project's ` gitignore ` file contains a list of files and folders that git should ignore when tracking a project. Because all Studio projects contain a set of files that git should _not_ include in its version control, you can create a `gitignore` file when creating a new Mule Project in Studio.

. Create a new Mule Project (*File* > *New* > *Mule Project*).
. In the first pane of the *New Mule Project* wizard (see image below), check **Create a default .gitignore file:**

. Click *Finish* to save and open your new project.

[NOTE]
Studio stores the *`gitignore` file* as a hidden file in the project's root directory. To view the contents of the file, change the settings of your operating system to display hidden files.

== gitignore File Contents

A `gitignore` file generally includes several files and folders that are commonly part of Java and Eclipse projects. A `gitignore` file prepared in Studio contains a few more Studio-specific elements (see table below).

|Studio-specific Ignored File or Folder |Reason
|

[source]
----
.studio/
----

|A hidden folder, it contains information that is irrelevant for synchronizing such as cached metadata files that git does not need to track.
|

[source]
----
flows/
----

|Including this folder in `gitignore` ensures that git does not track visual changes in the canvas which have do not affect the working of the flow.
|

[source]
----
target/
----

|Including this folder in `gitignore` ensures that git does not track the elements Studio uses to construct the target folder upon build.
