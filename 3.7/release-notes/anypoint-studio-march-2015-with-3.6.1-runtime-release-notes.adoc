[TIP]
Upgrading from an existing instance of Anypoint Studio or previous Mule runtime version? Refer to the link:#AnypointStudioMarch2015with3.6.1RuntimeReleaseNotes-migration[Migration Guide].

This release also supports the Mule ESB 3.6.1 runtime which addresses a critical security issue.

== Migration Guide

This section presents configuration considerations you may want to adjust when migrating from a previous version of a Mule runtime, or previous version of Studio. mailto:support@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] if you have a question about a specific migration activity or concern.

[NOTE]
====
Because the base version of Eclipse used by Anypoint Studio has changed from 3.8 to 4.4 (Eclipse Luna) in the January 2015 release of Studio, Studio *cannot be updated* from versions that are older than the January 2015 release. If that's the case, you must download and install the latest version.

If you already have the last version of Studio (January 2015) no special migration considerations are needed, use *Help* > *Check for Updates.*
====

* Mule ESB 3.6.1 only works in Anypoint Studio March 2015 Release or older. Older Mule ESB runtimes can still be installed in the new Anypoint Studio release.
* APIkit 1.5.1 only works in runtimes whose versions are less than 3.6.0. APIkit 1.6.0 works in the 3.6.0 runtime and above (see https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/STUDIO-5955[JIRA STUDIO-5955]).
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java 7 ]is required for Anypoint Studio. If you are deploying to Java 6 runtimes, you can continue to configure Java 6 as the Java runtime for your project.

[TIP]
To replace the deprecated HTTP connector for the new link:/documentation/display/current/HTTP+Connector[high-performance HTTP Connector], refer to link:/documentation/display/current/Migrating+to+the+New+HTTP+Connector[Migrating to the New HTTP Connector].

If you wish to install a previous runtime or a community runtime, follow the instructions to link:/documentation/display/current/Adding+Community+Runtime[add additional runtimes] to your new instance of Studio.

=== APIkit Considerations

When downloading this version of Anypoint Studio fresh, it includes two versions of APIkit:

* 1.5.2 - Works with runtimes lower than 3.6.0 (not included)  
* 1.6.1 - Supports the new HTTP connector and works with runtimes 3.6.0 and above +

When upgrading from an old version of Anypoint Studio, an update of 1.5.2 Apikit version is performed automatically, however version 1.6.1 is not included in the update and must be manually installed. You can install this by going to *Help* > *Install New Software* and selecting the *APIkit* *Update Site* from the *Work with* drop-down menu.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

[NOTE]
====
*Important*

This version of Anypoint Studio requires Java 7. Java 6 is not supported, and Java 8 is not supported by the Mule 3.6.0 Runtime or later.
====

For most use cases, Anypoint Studio March 2015 with 3.6.1 Runtime does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Anypoint Studio October 2014 with 3.5.2 Runtime. MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4 GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM. Please contact MuleSoft with any questions you may have about system requirements.
