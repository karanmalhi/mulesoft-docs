= CloudHub at a Glance
:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, api

Before getting started with CloudHub, it's important to understand some basic concepts. After this short overview, you can build your first CloudHub integration with the link:/docs/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub[Hello World on CloudHub] tutorial!

== CloudHub and Anypoint Studio

CloudHub is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS). It allows you to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications, create new APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premise applications with cloud services, and much more. With Anypoint Studio – the user-friendly development tool – you can quickly build these integration applications and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks. This guide  helps you learn the basics and get started developing your first applications.

== CloudHub and the Anypoint Platform for APIs

CloudHub was recently unified with the Anypoint Platform for APIs, which brings many benefits for customers including single sign-on across both products, more powerful access management capabilities such as individual roles per environment, and a consistent user experience with the rest of the Anypoint Platform. If you are an existing or previous CloudHub customer and want to know about how these changes affect your account and deployments, see the link:/docs/display/current/CloudHub+R40+Migration+Guide[CloudHub R40 Migration Guide].

== Mule Flows

The underlying configuration for your CloudHub integration is a "Mule Flow". Mule flows are made of individual components called Message Processors. These components act as the building blocks for your integration. As you build your flow with message processors, you are defining how "messages" – or data-content – flows from one component to the next.

As an example, a CloudHub integration can monitor, or poll, your Salesforce instance for any changes across all of your accounts. When a change occurs, the integration converts the changed data to a CSV file, and then uploads the file to your on-premises SFTP site. The Mule flow would contain three Message Processors and look like this:

These flows are quickly assembled inside Mule Studio with just a few clicks and pieces of configuration. In just a few minutes you can have a complete working integration between your SaaS services and your on-premise systems.

== Message Processors

Message processors allow you to do almost anything: connect to SaaS services, transform data, connect to various protocols, filter data, and much more. Each message processor has an icon in the Mule Studio Palette so you can drag it inside of your flow and configure it. Message processors fall into one of six categories, and are easy to locate in the Mule Studio Palette within their appropriate category:

|Category |Description
|link:/docs/display/current/Anypoint+Connectors[Anypoint Connectors] |Anypoint Connectors connect via protocols or to SaaS services and on-premises applications such as as Salesforce, MongoDB, CMIS, NetSuite, Magento, Intacct, and many more systems. For a full list, see our http://www.mulesoft.org/connectors[list of connectors].
|link:/docs/display/current/Transformers[Transformers] |Transformers help you change from one data format to another. Use transformers out-of-the-box, or add scripts using your favorite scripting language.
|link:/docs/display/current/Scopes[Scopes] |Scopes provide advanced processing, such as asynchronous invocations, polling, sub flows, and more.
|link:/docs/display/current/Components[Components] |Components allow you to write reusable business logic with Java, or a scripting language, and also create or invoke web services.
|link:/docs/display/current/Filters[Filters] |Filters determine how messages can proceed through your Mule flow.
|link:/docs/display/current/Routers[Flow Controls] |Flow Controls allow you to route messages to different locations – whether another flows or different external service. They operate on collections of data, and can broadcast messages, and more.

== Data Mapping

While Anypoint DataMapper is technically a message processor, it deserves special mention here. It's responsible for helping you map different data formats - whether it's data from cloud services, or file formats like CSV, JSON, Excel files, or XML. It makes data integration a snap with it's easy to use drag and drop interface.

== Applications

Flows are packaged into applications, and then deployed to CloudHub. It's nearly an automated process from within Mule Studio, as Anypoint Studio handles the packaging and upload of your application. You can build, deploy and run your integration without ever leaving Anypoint Studio.

== CloudHub Management Console

Once your application is deployed to CloudHub's multi-tenant runtime, you can http://cloudhub.io/login.html[log in] to CloudHub's management console. It allows you to triage problems, view logs, set up alerts, view dashboards, and more. Follow the simple steps in the link:/docs/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub[Hello World] tutorial to setup your free CloudHub account, and then log in to the console.
