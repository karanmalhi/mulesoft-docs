== Before You Begin

This step in the walkthrough assumes that you have either designed, built, and deployed a new API or a RAML layer for an existing legacy API to a Mule runtime, OR you chose to proxy an existing legacy API without creating a RAML layer for it. In either case, you wish to create a proxy for your API's inbound endpoint so that you can govern the API with SLAs and runtime policies. The proxy endpoint will be the one that you expose to your API users.

You must be an API Version Owner for the T-Shirt Service API to complete these steps.

== Create an Endpoint

The first step is to create an endpoint for your API on the API Version Details page.

. Click *Manage*, under *API URL*. +

. In the *API defined by* field, select the type of endpoint from the list, based on your use case: +
* If you are entering the endpoint of an API which was built out using APIkit, select *HTTP* *URL*.
* If you proceeded straight here because you want to follow the path of managing an existing API without RAML, select *WSDL* (in our example we will be using a SOAP API.)
. Enter the URI of the inbound endpoint of your API, based on your use case: +
* If you selected RAML spec, enter the address of the inbound endpoint of your deployed APIkit application, which may be running on-premises or on CloudHub. For example: `http://localhost:8086/api` or `http://ab-tshirt-orders.cloudhub.io`
* If you selected WSDL, enter this address: `http://tshirt-service.cloudhub.io/?wsdl`
. Click *Save*.

== Download the Proxy

[IMPORTANT]
This step is only needed if you're planning to deploy your proxy on premises or to deploy to CloudHub manually. +
If you plan to deploy to CloudHub automatically, then there's no need to download this deployable file.

Now that you have registered an endpoint for your API version, note that it is tagged as "Not registered". In order to manage the API behind this endpoint with SLAs and policies, the Anypoint Platform for APIs needs to register the endpoint with the agent. The way to do this for an already implemented API is by downloading a proxy application for your endpoint, then deploying that proxy to your API Gateway.

. Click *Generate proxy*.
. Save the resulting .zip file to a convenient location.

== Next

Congratulations! You've successfully set an endpoint and downloaded an auto-generated proxy for your API. Next, go to link:/documentation/display/current/Walkthrough+Deploy+to+Gateway[Deploy to an API Gateway].
