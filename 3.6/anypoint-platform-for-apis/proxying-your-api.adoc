= Proxying Your API

This page describes how to obtain an auto-generated proxy for your API version, optionally modify it with additional code, and then deploy the proxy application to your API Gateway, which registers a proxy endpoint with the Anypoint Platform for APIs and allows you to govern your API by applying runtime policies to it. This page also describes the necessary architecture of a proxy application, in case you want to build your own.

== Prerequisites

To obtain an auto-generated proxy for your API version, you need to have API Version Owner permissions for the API, or be an Organization Administrator. 

To deploy a proxy application, you need a valid URL where your API is currently running. You also need one of the following:

* **on-premises**: Access to an on-premises API Gateway instance that has been configured to pair with your Anypoint Platform for APIs organization. If you still need to configure your on-premises API Gateway, follow link:/documentation/display/current/Configuring+an+API+Gateway[these instructions].
* *Automatic CloudHub deploy*: Valid permissions on both the CloudHub and the Anypoint Platform for APIs of your organization.
* *Manual CloudHub deploy*: A CloudHub account and a valid Anypoint Platform client id and client secret to pair your deployment with your Anypoint Platform for APIs organization.

== Generating a Proxy

. If you haven't already done so, you'll first need to click *Configure endpoint* on the *API Status* section of your API version details page to provide data about your endpoint. +

+
image:/documentation/download/attachments/123340337/api+status+new+empty.png?version=1&modificationDate=1422565828032[image]


. You will be prompted to configure several parameters, as shown below: +

+
image:/documentation/download/attachments/123340337/conf+for+cloud2.png?version=1&modificationDate=1422910962229[image] +


.. You can optionally choose to not have a proxy at all by picking "*Basic endpoint*", otherwise keep the default the option "*Endpoint with a proxy*".
.. Pick a *Type* for your proxy: +
* a simple link:#ProxyingYourAPI-http[REST proxy]
* if you have a RAML for your API, pick link:#ProxyingYourAPI-raml[RAML proxy] to take full advantage of it
* if you have a WSDL to expose pick link:#ProxyingYourAPI-soap[SOAP proxy]
.. Next, enter either the HTTP URL where your API is hosted, the baseUri from your RAML definition, or the URL where the WSDL can be accessed for a SOAP API.
.. If you tick the box labeled *configure proxy for CloudHub*, you enable the option to deploy your proxy both automatically and manually to CloudHub. Notice that once enabled, the port number below becomes fixed to a specific value which is required by CloudHub. Also notice that the Deploy after Saving box becomes available at the bottom.
.. If you're using a proxy, then set the proxy address. You can pick between HTTP or HTTPS protocols, select a port and specify a sub-path.
+
[NOTE]
Note that when deploying to CloudHub, you can only perform an automatic deploy when all your endpoints are HTTP. If your employ HTTPS, you must perform a manual deploy to CloudHub, or deploy on premise.

.. By default, all proxies are only compatible with the latest version of the API Gateway. If you need to use an older version of the API Gateway, you can enter the Advanced Settings section and pick a different version. +

.. Once you have entered this URL, click *Configure* to close this window. +


Below, select the tab that matches the way you want to deploy your proxy:

=== CloudHub - Automatic [TAB]

. In the API Status section of the API version page, click *Deploy Proxy* to automatically deploy your proxy application to CloudHub.
+
image:/documentation/download/attachments/123340337/deploy+button.png?version=1&modificationDate=1422912074347[image]
+

. In the deploy menu, submit an app name and choose an environment. The Gateway version is selected from what you configured on the Configure Endpoint section.
+
image:/documentation/download/attachments/123340326/set+up+deployment.png?version=1&modificationDate=1422565216062[image]
+
[TIP]
A link will then be provided to the actual CloudHub application for further management, from there you can then change the worker type, the environment, set advanced settings, etc. Under the API Status section, a new link will appear labeled *Manage CloudHub proxy* that takes you there.

. The status of the API deployment is indicated by the marker in the API Status section of the API version page. While the app is starting, a spinner appears. After it starts successfully, the light turns green.
+
[TIP]
Notice there should now be a new link under the API Status labeled **Re-deploy proxy**. If you make changes to the endpoint configuration you can click this to re-deploy your proxy application to the same CloudHub application.

=== Manual - On Premises or CloudHub [TAB]

. In the API Status section of the API version page, click *Download Proxy* to automatically build a deployable proxy application from what you have set up for this API version and download it as a .zip file. +

+
image:/documentation/download/attachments/123340337/download+proxy.png?version=2&modificationDate=1422911650521[image]


. Save the resulting .zip file. At this point you might want to modify this zip file as needed to adjust for port conflicts, use shared connector resources, or include custom code for logic that you wish to add to the proxy. +

. Now it's time to link:/documentation/display/current/Deploying+Your+API+or+Proxy[deploy your proxy applicatio]n to the API Gateway.
+
[TIP]
Once you deploy, notice the yellow circle in the status indicator turns green. Even when already deployed, any changes you make to your proxy on the portal – such as applying new policies or adding tiers – will immediately be reflected on your deployed proxy without the need to re-download or re-deploy anything.

== Understanding the Proxy Application

If you wish to inspect or change your proxy application, you can do so by opening it in http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio[Anypoint Studio]. You can also use Studio to build a proxy application from scratch, based on the models below. 

[NOTE]
Note that, because the auto-generated proxy applications all use the same inbound endpoint of `http://0.0.0.0:![p['http.port']]` by default, it is necessary to open and adjust your proxy applications if you are deploying more than one of them to the same API Gateway instance to link:/documentation/display/current/Localhost+Behavior+on+the+API+Gateway[avoid port conflicts].

The sections below introduce the anatomy of the automatically generated proxy applications for a REST API, a SOAP API, and RAML proxy.

=== Basic Anatomy of a REST Proxy

This section describes the structure of a REST proxy that you can auto-generate from the Anypoint Platform for APIs. From this basic structure, you can add additional functionality – to log data, for example. 

The purpose of a proxy application is to abstract your API to a layer that can be managed by the Anypoint Platform for APIs. A well-built proxy application for a REST API:

. Accepts incoming service calls from applications and routes them to the URI of your target API.
. Copies any message headers from the service call and pass them along to your API.
. Avoids passing internal Mule headers both to the API and back to the requester.  +
. Adds a flag that ensures that your target API's HTTP status codes are returned to the requesting app, and not overwritten by the proxy's own status codes.
. Captures message headers from your API's response and attaches them to the response message.
. Routes the response to the application that made the service call.

Here's what a basic REST proxy application looks like in Anypoint Studio's GUI.

Here is an XML configuration of the above REST API proxy.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the above template is a basic skeleton only. Your HTTP endpoints differ, and you may need to add additional configuration if your API requires HTTPS communication (as shown in link:/documentation/display/current/HTTPS+API+Proxy+Example[this example]) or link:/documentation/display/current/Managing+Internal+Links+in+API+Proxies[returns internal API URLs] as part of the response.

At minimum, the following attributes will be different, to match your API:

* `http:inbound-endpoint address`
* `http:outbound-endpoint address`

You can configure the property placeholders in the configuration in your `config.properties` file, which you can find in your Package Explorer under `src/main/resources`.

=== Basic Anatomy of a SOAP Proxy

This section describes the structure of a SOAP proxy that you can auto-generate from the Anypoint Platform for APIs. From this basic structure, you can add additional functionality – to log data, for example. 

The purpose of a proxy application is to abstract your API to a layer that can be managed by the Anypoint Platform for APIs. A well-built proxy application for a SOAP API:

. Accepts incoming service calls from applications and route them to the URI of your target API.
. Captures the Content-Type and stores it in a variable. +
. Verifies that the request's structure matches what is specified in the WSDL file.
. Copies any message headers from the service call into a format that can be passed along to your API, without passing on the headers that are generated internally by Mule. 
. Appends the Content-Type of the original message to the proxied API call. +
. Captures message headers from your API's response and attaches them to the response message, without passing on the headers that are generated by Mule.
. Once your API has issued a response, removes the message header named `connection` +
. Routes the response back to the application that made the service call.

Here's what a basic SOAP proxy application looks like in Anypoint Studio's GUI.

** `cxf:proxy-service service`
** `cxf:proxy-service payload`
** `cxf:proxy-service wsdlLocation`
** `http:outbound-endpoint host`
** `http:outbound-endpoint port`
** `http:outbound-endpoint path`

You can configure the property placeholders in the configuration in your `config.properties` file, which you can find in your Package Explorer under `src/main/resources`.

=== Basic Anatomy of a RAML Proxy

When you set your API URL in the Anypoint Platform using the RAML type, the proxy that is generated uses the RAML defined within the API version and honors the content of that RAML. This proxy type differs from the pass-through proxies that you can generate from a basic HTTP or WSDL URL in some important ways:

* Because the proxy honors the content of the RAML file, requests sent to the proxy that do not match the RAML definition (for example, a request for a resource that does not exist) are rejected by the proxy itself, rather than being passed through the proxy to the API for the appropriate response.
* The RAML proxy application exposes the API Console at the API Gateway.

To create the RAML proxy application, the Anypoint Platform obtains the inbound endpoint from the RAML's baseUri value.

Here's what a basic RAML proxy application looks like in Anypoint Studio's GUI.

== Modifying a Proxy Application

You may wish to modify the auto-generated proxy to adjust the inbound endpoint to link:/documentation/display/current/Localhost+Behavior+on+the+API+Gateway[avoid port conflicts], or to add additional functionality to the proxy with your own code. For example, you may want to log data to a file or send it to your Splunk account with the Anypoint Splunk Connector. You can modify the proxy application to perform this additional functionality, provided that you leave its essential structures in place.

To modify a proxy application, import it into Anypoint Studio.

. In Studio, select *File > Import...*
. In the Import dialog, expand the *Mule* node, then select *Anypoint Studio Project from External Location*. Click *Next*.
. In the *Project Root* field, navigate to the proxy folder that you just downloaded from the Anypoint Platform.
. Edit the project *Name* to be unique, then select the *API Gateway runtime* from the Server Runtime dropdown. Don't have it installed? See link:/documentation/display/current/Configuring+an+API+Gateway#ConfiguringanAPIGateway-ConfiguringAnypointStudioforIntegrationwithyourAnypointPlatformforAPIsOrganization[the instructions].
. Click *Finish*.

You can now edit your proxy application in Studio's visual editor or XML editor.
