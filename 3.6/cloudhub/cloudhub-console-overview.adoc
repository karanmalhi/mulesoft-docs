:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, manage

The CloudHub Console provides point and click access to your integration applications running on CloudHub. Once logged in, you can perform the following operations:

* Create and deploy a new application
* Manage an existing CloudHub application
* View application log data
* Monitor message statistics for your application

Before accessing the CloudHub Console, you must first link:/documentation/display/current/Creating+an+Account[create an account]. After you have an account, you can log into CloudHub from the https://cloudhub.io/login.html[CloudHub login page].

== Dashboard Overview

When you first log into the Anypoint Platform, click  *CloudHub* from the top menu. You  see the Applications menu where you can get a quick view of the applications that are currently deployed and running for your account:

Creating an application is the first step to link:/documentation/display/current/Deploying+a+CloudHub+Application[Deploying a CloudHub Application]. Each application must have a unique application domain. If you use the link:/documentation/display/current/Command+Line+Tools[Command Line Tools] or Mule Studio, you do not need to perform this step using the console. After you create at least one application, you  see your applications listed here, including the number of transactions and the percentage of CPU usage over the past hour.

Next to each application name, you can see an icon that represents the current status of the application. The meaning of the status icons is summarized below:
