:keywords: release notes, esb


The second maintenance release for Mule 2.0 includes new support for parodying Web services, stream-based XPath routing, a more efficient http://www.mulesource.org/jira/browse/MULE-3466[XSLT engine], major improvements to the http://www.mulesource.org/jira/browse/MULE-3484[Jetty transport] and http://www.mulesource.org/jira/browse/MULE-2713[Scripting module], as well as a number of fixes/improvements for CXF, Transactions, Notifications, and more.

Two new examples have been added: "Bookstore" which illustrates CXF and "Change Machine" which illustrates Scripting using Groovy and Python. And although there's still lots to do, significant progress has been made towards updating the http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation-3.2/display/MULEUSER/Home[User Guide] and Schema Annotations for Mule 2.0
