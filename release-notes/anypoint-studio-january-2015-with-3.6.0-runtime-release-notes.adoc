MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of *Anypoint Studio January 2015*. Our new version of Anypoint Studio includes the 3.6.0 Runtime and a trial license for Enterprise Edition. This release includes many productivity enhancers, support for new/existing Mule ESB features, visual enhancements and a major upgrade to the base Eclipse IDE.

== New Features and Functionality

*  *Mule 3.6 runtime support*: Anypoint Studio now supports all the latest features from the Mule ESB 3.6.0 release, including the new HTTP connector and updated AMQP connector.
* *Connect to APIs easily using RAML:*  If you're using RAML, you can now use it to connect to your API using Studio and the new HTTP connector. Studio will provide content assist for the resources and operations, as well as DataSense capabilities - meaning you'll have instant access to visualize and map the payload.
*  *Flow design improvements and Eclipse upgrade:*  Simplified toolbar and an improved flow design. Studio now has separate containers for message sources and message logic, ensuring readability of flows.  You can also  collapse the exception strategy sections of flows.
*  *Upgraded Eclipse framework:* Anypoint Studio is now based on Eclipse 4.4.
*  *Run multiple applications at once and share resources with domains:*  Now you can run multiple applications in a single runtime by creating runtime configurations that launch multiple applications. Shared resources are also supported, allowing you to create shared domain projects that contain connectors. To start, you can create a new Mule Domain project and change your applications to use this shared domain through the ` mule-project.xml  ` settings.

[NOTE]
Upgrading from an existing instance of Anypoint Studio or previous Mule runtime version? Refer to the link:#AnypointStudioJanuary2015with3.6.0RuntimeReleaseNotes-migration[Migration Guide].

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

[NOTE]
====
*Important* +

This version of Anypoint Studio requires Java 7. Java 6 is not supported, and Java 8 is not currently supported by the Mule 3.6.0 Runtime or later.
====

For most use cases, Anypoint Studio January 2015 with 3.6.0 Runtime does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Anypoint Studio October 2014 with 3.5.2 Runtime. MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4 GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM. Please contact MuleSoft with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Deprecated in this Release

The following list of Message Processors has been deprecated:  

* HTTP Endpoint / Connector
* HTTP Response Builder (Component)
* HTTP Response to Object (Transformer)
* HTTP Response to String (Transformer)
* Message to HTTP Response (Transformer)
* Object to HTTP Request (Transformer)
* Body to Parameter (Transformer)
* Service Lookup (Connector)
* Result set to Maps (Transformer)

== Migration Guide

This section presents configuration considerations you may want to adjust when migrating from a previous version of a Mule runtime, or previous version of Studio. mailto:support@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] if you have a question about a specific migration activity or concern.

=== Migrating to the Latest Version

[NOTE]
Because the base version of Eclipse used by Anypoint Studio has changed from 3.8 to 4.4 (Eclipse Luna), Studio *cannot be updated*. Users must download and install the latest version.

* Mule ESB 3.6.0 only works in Anypoint Studio January 2015 Release (version 5.0.0). Older Mule ESB runtimes can still be installed in the new Anypoint Studio release.
* API Gateway requires version 1.3.1 to work with the new Studio version.
* APIkit 1.5.1 only works in runtimes whose versions are smaller than 3.6.0. APIkit 1.6.0 works in the 3.6.0 runtime and above (see https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/STUDIO-5955[JIRA STUDIO-5955]).
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java 7 ]   is now required for Anypoint Studio. If you are deploying to Java 6 runtimes, you can continue to configure Java 6 as the Java runtime for your project.

[TIP]
To replace the deprecated HTTP connector for the new link:/mule-user-guide/http-connector[high-performance HTTP Connector], refer to link:/mule-user-guide/migrating-to-the-new-http-connector[Migrating to the New HTTP Connector].

If you wish to install a previous runtime or a community runtime, follow the instructions to link:/mule-user-guide/adding-community-runtime[add additional runtimes] to your new instance of Studio.
