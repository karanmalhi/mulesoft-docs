= Mule ESB 3.6.0 Release Notes
:keywords: release notes


*January 15, 2015*

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of the *Mule ESB 3.6.0* runtime, which introduces new functionality, improvements, and fixes to our industry-leading ESB software. 

These release notes apply to both the Community and the Enterprise runtimes of Mule ESB 3.6.0. Where appropriate, we have applied an *_Enterprise_* marker to identify features or functionality that are available only in the Enterprise runtime.

*Note*: Mule ESB 3.6.n uses log4j2. Ensure that you're using the latest logging configuration. For more information about this change, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/logging-in-mule[Logging in Mule].

[NOTE]
In case of having any issues with APIKit, consider the upgrading to the latest minor release of APIKit.

== New Features and Functionality

* *High-Performance HTTP:* Mule 3.6 contains a new, high performance version of HTTP, which supports non-blocking I/O. The previous HTTP connector continues to be supported for all 3.x releases and until the next major release of Mule ESB. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/migrating-to-the-new-http-connector[HTTP Connector] for more information.
* *AMQP Connector:* An updated and officially supported version of our AMQP connector. It is built on top of the previously-available community AMQP transport, but includes additional functionality such as support for multi-channel receivers, fixes many bugs and contains an upgraded client library. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/amqp-connector[AMQP Connector] for more information.

|MULE-6866 |Groovy was upgraded to version 2.3.7-indy. If this produces any compatibility issues with an existing script you should either update your script (recommended) or go back to a prior version by replacing the groovy jar at MULE_HOME/lib/opt
|MULE-7842 |Jersey was upgraded to version 2.11 which implements jax-rs 2.0. Applications using the jersey module will need upgrading. For further reference see Jersey's migration guide at https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/migration.html#mig-1.x
|MULE-7842 |javax.annotation:javax.annotation-api was upgraded to version 1.2. We're now importing this dependency directly while before we did it through the geronimo-specs project
|MULE-7906 |Jython was upgraded to version 2.7.3b3. If this produces any compatibility issues with an existing script you should either update your script (recommended) or go back to a prior version by replacing the jython jar at MULE_HOME/lib/opt
|MULE-7740 |Rhino was upgraded to version 1.7R4. If this produces any compatibility issues with an existing script you should either update your script (recommended) or go back to a prior version by replacing the rhino jar at MULE_HOME/lib/opt
|MULE-7946 |The following dependencies were removed from the distribution since they're no longer necessary as 1.7 is now the minimum required JDK version for running mule: +
* geronimo-j2ee-management_1.0_spec-1.1.jar +
* jaxb-api-2.1.jar +
* jaxws-api-2.2.1.jar +
* jsr250-api-1.0.jar +
* jsr181-api-1.0-MR1.jar +

* commons-codec: from version 1.3 to 1.9 +
* commons-exec: from version 1.1 to 1.2 +
* commons-net: from version 2.0 to 2.2
|MULE-7951 |xmlunit has been upgraded to version 1.5
|MULE-7919 |json-schema-validation-filter in the json module was deprecated and will be removed in Mule 4.0. Use the new validate-schema message processor instead.
|MULE-7919 |The following classes have been deprecated. Use JsonSchemaValidator instead +
* JsonSchemaFilter +
* JsonSchemaJsonValidationFilter +
* JsonSchemaValidationFilter +
* JsonSChemaXsdValidationFilter
|MULE-7919 |The following dependencies were upgraded: +
* jackson-databind: from version 2.1.1 to 2.4.3 +
* joda-time: from version 1.6 to 2.5
|MULE-7919 |The dependency org.kitchen-eel:json-schema-validator was removed and replaced with com.github.fge:json-schema-validator:2.2.5. If you still need to use that dependency, you can safely add it back to your application/runtime.
|MULE-7987 |The following dependencies were upgraded: +
* saxon: from version 9.1.0.8 to 9.6.0.1-HE +
* woodstox-core-asl: from version 4.1.4 to 4.4.1 +
* stax2-api: from version 3.1.1 to 3.1.4
|MULE-7030 |The following features have been deprecated in favor of <expression-filter>: +
* jaxen-filter +
* jxpath-filter
|MULE-7030 |The following features have been deprecated in favor of <expression-transformer>: +
* jxpath-extractor-transformer +
* bean: expression evaluator
|MULE-7030 |The following features have been deprecated in favor of the new xpath3() MEL Function +
* xpath: expression evaluator +
* xpath2: expression evaluator (in favor of the xpath3() MEL function) +
* xpath() MEL Function
|MULE-7030 |The xpath-filter element is now namespace aware. If you're using it with XPath expressions which reference custom namespaces, you now have to declare them in a namespace-manager element or use a wildcard (*:/title instead of book:title)
|MULE-8001 |The xquery-transformer element will now always return a java List when no return type has explicitly been specified
|MULE-7983 |Devkit based Cloud Connectors with OAuth support will now use the new HTTP connector by default, unless the useTransportForUris configuration flag is set to true (see MULE-8066). The connector-ref attribute now accepts either an HTTP transport 'config' or a new 'listener-config' element. Devkit based connectors using OAuth1 will not support the new HTTP connector
|MULE-7731 |The default value of the 'cacheJmsSessions' attribute in the JMS connector element is now 'true' to provide better out of the box performance. This attribute can be set 'false' to disable caching as in 3.5.
|MULE-7731 |The <jms:caching-connection-factory> has been deprecated. It can still but used in 3.6, but it not necessary given that from Mule 3.6 JMS connections cache Sessions/Producers by default when a CachingConnectionFactory has not been configured explicitly.
|MULE-7731 |org.mule.transport.jms.xa.ConnectionFactoryWrapper has been renamed to org.mule.transport.jms.xa.DefaultXAConnectionFactoryWrapper.
|MULE-8082 |XStream was upgraded from version 1.4.2 to 1.4.7
|MULE-8083 |JXPath expression evaluator no longer accepts external entities when payload is not already a Document
|MULE-8004 |Examples are no longer included in the distribution. Check the README file in the examples folder for more information
|MULE-8004 |Derby is no longer included in the distribution
|MULE-7736 |From Mule 3.6, SEDA queues used with the 'queued-asynchronous' processing strategy are now bound to four times the maximum number of active threads by default. This change permits stages to be decoupled as well as peaks in traffic to be handled while avoiding OutOfMemoryException's. The queue size can be increased in configuration or set to '0' for 3.5 behaviour (unbound).

For most use cases, the 3.6.0 Runtime does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by the 3.5.X Runtime. MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4 GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM. Please contact MuleSoft with any questions you may have about system requirements.
