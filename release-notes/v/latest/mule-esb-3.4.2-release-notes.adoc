== Noteworthy

* *Management Console Installation or Upgrade*: Depending on your requirements and current instance of MMC, you require one of two .`war` files to install or upgrade MMC. 
* *Management Console improvement*: We have made it easier to persist state and tracking data to an external database, requiring only a couple of property files and minor XML configurations in almost all cases.
* *Management Console improvement:* Out of the box, MMC now includes the ability to encrypt passwords in order to connect to the state and tracking databases and to bind to LDAP.
* *Management Console improvement:* We have greatly improved both the performance of business events and the functionality of queries.


== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Mule ESB 3.4.2 does not change the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/hardware-and-software-requirements[hardware and software system requirements] established by Mule ESB 3.4.1.  Please https://www.mulesoft.com/contact[contact MuleSoft] with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Important Notes and Known Issues in this Release

This list covers some of the known issues with Mule Management Console 3.4.2. Please read this list before reporting any issues you may have spotted. (There are no known issues with Mule ESB 3.4.2 Enterprise Runtime.)

=== Mule Management Console

[cols=",",]
|===
|Adding a cluster to a group |If you place a cluster in a server group, you may experience issues with deployments which target the group instead of the cluster directly.  +
**Workaround:** Use the cluster as one of the direct targets of your deployments. If you experience issues, check the apps directory in your Mule server(s) to confirm functionality.
|Adding a server to a group |If you add a server to a group via the server details panel (using the settings tab and editing the server info), deployments targeting the group are not transferred to the newly added server. +
**Workaround:** Use the Add to Group button in the server list grid. 
|Error Messages |Some error messages in the MMC main window may contain a "See More" link which, when clicked, displays a new window containing only the text `null`. +
**Workaround:** There is no applicable workaround, but you can safely ignore this issue.
