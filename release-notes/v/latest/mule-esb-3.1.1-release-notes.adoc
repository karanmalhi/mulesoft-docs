= Mule ESB 3.1.1 Release Notes
:keywords: release notes, esb

The Mule team is pleased to announce the availability of Mule ESB 3.1.1. This is a follow-up release to link:/release-notes/mule-esb-3.1.0-ce-release-notes[Mule ESB 3.1], which continues MuleSoft's commitment to making Mule the industry's most powerful, simplest to use, and up-to-date Open Source ESB.

[NOTE]
In previous versions of Mule ESB, you were required to set the MULE_HOME environment variable in order for Mule to start. As of version 3.1, the MULE_HOME variable is not required. If you have an existing MULE_HOME variable pointing to a previous version of Mule, you may see inconsistent results. Therefore, if you have previously set this variable, you should unset it.

== New in Mule ESB Version 3.1.1

=== Example Launcher

Both the Community and the Enterprise editions of Mule ESB Version 3.1.1 include a new Example Launcher application which allows you to discover the power of Mule right out of the box. Here are http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/MULE3INTRO/Examples+for+3.1.1[detailed instructions] viewing examples with and without the new Example Launcher.

=== Documentation Improvements

A number of new reference topics are included in the Mule ESB documentation. These are explained fully in this http://blogs.mulesoft.org/in-medias-res-mule-3-1/[blog]. In short, the topics listed below represent more complete, consistent, and hopefully more useful documentation for the modules and transports that constitute the core value of the Mule ESB. At the top of each new page, you can rate the usefulness of each page. Also, you can give feedback by clicking on the thumbs up or down icons at the bottom of each of these new topics.

=== Change to Mule Configuration Pattern Namespace

Previously, the ws-proxy pattern was in its own namespace, while others were in the `core-mule` namespace. As of 3.1.1, all Mule Configuration Patterns will be in this `pattern` namespace. The patterns' element names have been changed, though the old names are still supported for compatibility. They will be removed in a future release.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Current element name |Previous element name
|pattern:bridge |bridge
|pattern:simple-service |simple-service
|pattern:validator |validator
|pattern:web-service-proxy |ws:proxy
|===

As part of this change, a new maven artifact `mule-pattern-core` has been created to contain the patterns. The artifact `mule-module-ws` has been deleted.

=== CXF upgrade

CXF has been upgraded to version 2.3.1. You can see the release notes for this CXF version at https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310511&version=12315385&styleName=Html&Create=Create[CXF 2.3.1 Release Notes].

== Mule ESB Management Console

_*Enterprise Edition*_

* **Per-Instance ".mule" subfolders**: If you are running multiple embedded MULE instances then the `.mule` folder contains a single subfolder for each instance, also preventing persistence collisions. The `.mule` folder will be contained in the working directory from where the container was launched. For instance, if you start the container with something like `apache-tomcat/bin> ./run`, the `.mule` folder would be here: `apache-tomcat-xxx/bin/.mule`.

* *Mule agent port ranges*: When you start a mule instance (embedded or stand-alone) that includes the MMC agent, the agent will select a port from a range to avoid collision with other agents.

The default port range is 7777-7877. This can be overridden, for example, to specify a fixed port:

----

./mule -M-Dmule.mmc.bind.port=7777
----

to specify a range:

----
./mule -M-Dmule.mmc.bind.port=8888-8898
----

Open Issues +
  +
 The following jiras are open against this release of Mule ESB:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===========
|Key |Component/s |Summary |Workaround
|MMC-740 |Mule Management Console |MMC screen showing three unregistered servers at the same location |Start multiple instances of Mule sequentially to allow proper port binding.
|EE-2113 |Mule ESB |The populate_m2_repo still requires MULE_HOME to be set. | 
|EE-2197 |Mule ESB |Widget example still requires MULE_HOME to be set. | 
|MMC-726 |Mule Management Console |if a mule instance is manually registered in MMC (rather than auto-discovered) then it is expected that the mule instance always be available on the same ip address and port. |Best practice - change port range for automatic port binding to be well above the range with manual port assignment.
|MMC-765 |Mule Management Console |Applications/servers removed from a deployment are not undeployed from servers. Applications manually started/stopped (via MMC or by manual copy in apps/ folder) do not trigger automatic reconciliation check. Down servers are ignored during deployment operation. This might lead to inconsistencies. |Before modifying a deployment, undeploy it, modify it, then redeploy. To remove an application from a deployment, force undeploy on the deployment before removing an app from it. When the deployment is deployed again, the removed app will not be available.
|MMC-754 |Mule Management Console |"After" payload is not visible in the Flow Analyzer for async blocks and one-way end-points |N/A
|MMC-663 |Mule Management Console |Alert description is not displayed for raised alerts |Although the information is not shown, it is correctly saved. To verify this, go to to alert edit mode.
|===========
