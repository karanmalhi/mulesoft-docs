* **Performance improvement in Studio's XML Validator**  The performance of Studios XML Validator has been significantly improved, facilitating quicker navigation between the Visual and XML editors and reliable data persistance between editors. 
* **Maven integration improvements in Studio ** A new populate repository improves the experience of Maven integration and reliability in Studio. 
* *Studio Anypoint Connector validation with runtime*  When you run an application that contains versions of Anypoint Connectors which conflict with the version of your projects runtime, Mule displays a warning to advise you of the conflict specifics and asks if you wish to proceed to run the application. 
* *Support for multiple runtimes* *in Studio*  Beyond the Community runtime, you can download multiple Enterprise runtimes in Studio, using different runtimes with your Studio projects as desired.  Read more about link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/installing-extensions[installing extra runtimes in Studio].
* *Upgraded CXF*  The CXF framework, which Mule uses to work with Web services, is upgraded to version 2.5.9.
* *Improved cluster performance*  When using a cluster, systems which involve high CPU consumption function smoothly.
* *Fixed continuations support on the Jetty transport*

=== Mule Studio

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|STUDIO-3239 |sObject in Salesforce connector is lost in Linux
|n/a |When installing a new ESB runtime, Studio might change the runtime version on your current projects in the workspace. This has been fix for project created with the current release but it will affect any project created with a previous version of Studio ( current: 3.4.0-201305141336 ) in your workspace.
|===

=== Mule Management Console

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%"]
|===
|n/a |*Known issue*: If you place a cluster in a server group, you may experience issues with deployments which target the group instead of the cluster directly.
*Workaround:* Use the cluster as one of the direct targets of your deployments. If you experience issues, check the apps directory in your Mule(s) to to confirm that they are functional.
|n/a |*Known issue:* If you add a server to a group via the server details panel, using the settings tab and editing the server info, deployments targeting the group are not transferred to the newly added server. +
*Workaround:* Use the Add to Group button in the server list grid.

|MP-299 a|
On Rest API, when listing flows, password information is shown for secure protocols (eg sftp).

Hide password for secure endpoints.

|MP-275 |SFTP endpoint shows details about user and password. Hide password for secure endpoints.
|MP-295 |SFTP username and password visible in plain text in MMC. Hide password for secure endpoints.

|SE-133 |Cannot compare with Boolean JMX Attribute. Consider Boolean attribute for JMX alert. Defining alerts based on boolean attributes now works properly.
|SE-34 |In a Mule application embeded deployments when clicking on flow in mmc an error occurs. Fix Flows tab for embedded Mule ESB. It allows clicking on flows in the flow tab to get further details.
