:keywords: api gateway, connector, release notes

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the 2.0 release of the API Gateway runtime. This release includes support for the new high-performance link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/migrating-to-the-new-http-connector[HTTP Connector] and enhanced analytics tracking capabilites when using the on premises version of the Anypoint Platform. The release also includes bug fixes and performance improvements.

== Compatibility

* ESB Runtime 3.7
* APIKit 1.7
* Anypoint Studio 5.2

== New Features

* External AES OAuth2 validation policy. See  link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/external-oauth-2.0-token-validation-policy[External OAuth 2.0 Token Validation Policy].
* New HTTP Listener Connector. See  link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-listener-connector[HTTP Listener Connector].
* Out of the box domain with a listener configuration that uses port 8081.
* Gateway support of on-premise access in Anypoint Management Center.
* Analytics enrichment for on-premise Anypoint Management Center gateways
* Non-blocking support. See https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Flow+Processing+Strategies#FlowProcessingStrategies-Non-BlockingProcessingStrategy[Non-Blocking Processing].
* Java 8 support.

== Fixed In This Release

* AGW-327 - 403 HTTP code (forbidden) when OAuth access token key is empty.
* AGW-424 - Have a separate thread for fetching policies and for activating api endpoints
* SE-2099 - API Gateway | HTTP query.param truncated by ';' character +
* SE-1904 - Can't manage multiple "Set-Cookie" headers
* SE-1775 - HTTP Outbound call gets 404 on API Gateway, but 200 on Mule ESB
* SE-1545 - OAuth enforcement absorbs CORS preflight calls

== Deprecated in this Release

* With the HTTP listener support, the old endpoint based version of the HTTP connector is no longer supported in 2.0. Use the link:/release-notes/migration-guide-to-api-gateway-2.0.0-or-later[migration tool] for existing proxies.
* Use register-as when defining autodiscovery for endpoints removed from the schema.

== Migration Guide

. Modify and migrate all deployed applications and proxies to use the new link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-listener-connector[HTTP listener] used in the 2.0 runtime. For automatically generated (but not modified) proxies of versions 1.3.X or older, there is a link:/release-notes/migration-guide-to-api-gateway-2.0.0-or-later[migration tool.] However, custom apps or post-generation modified proxies will need to be manually modified and re-deployed. 
. Custom policies continue to work. However as-is if policy violations occur, these are not reported to analytics as such events need to include their ID. To ensure that violations are reporting, the policy needs to be modified to include an ID. See link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/applying-custom-policies[Applying Custom Policies] for examples of both runtimes.

== Known Issues

If you need to edit a proxy in Anypoint Studio (typically to include HTTPS credentials), you can't perform an auto-deploy directly from the Anypoint Studio UI to CloudHub. You must first export your Mule project as a .zip file and then manually upload it to your CloudHub account. This procedure will be simplified with the next update site of Anypoint Studio, scheduled to be released in July.
