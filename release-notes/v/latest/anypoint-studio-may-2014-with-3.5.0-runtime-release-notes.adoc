:keywords: release notes, anypoint studio


<<Migration Guide, Skip to Migration Guide>>

May 20, 2014

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of *Anypoint Studio May 2014 with 3.5.0 Runtime*.

Our new version of Anypoint Studio (formerly known as Mule Studio) functions as a single download and includes the 3.5.0 runtime with an Enterprise trial license. With two entirely new message processors – the Web Service Consumer and the Database Connector – this release offers some dramatic improvements to the way you build integration applications. Further, you can now take advantage of batch processing functionality,  scatter-gather functionality, and share resources between applications. Building on the existing DataSense functionality, Studio includes a DataSense Explorer that gives you design-time visibility into the data contained within the messages your application will process. 

Further, these release notes offer some detail on the tangentially released APIkit version 1.3. See <<New Features and Functionality>> section below. Access the independent Release Notes for version 6.0.0 of API Manager Agent.  Refer to our Release Strategy for full details about our most recently released runtimes and their deployment options.

== New Features and Functionality

* *Mule Studio -> Anypoint Studio*: New name, same great taste! To better synchronize with our Anypoint Platform, Studio earned a new moniker to fit in with the rest of the crowd.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Database+Connector[New Database Connector]*: This new connector allows you to connect with almost any JDBC relational database, consistently using the same interface for every case. You can run diverse SQL operations on your database, including Select, Insert, Update, Delete, and even Stored Procedures.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Web+Service+Consumer[New Web Service Consumer]*: This new connector allows you to consume a web service from within your Mule application using information automatically extracted from the service's WSDL using DataSense.
* *Palette Simplification*: In the Studio palette, Endpoints and Cloud Connectors categories have been merged in one category called link:/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Connectors[Connectors].
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Batch+Streaming+and+Job+Execution[Batch Processing Improvements]*: Batch Processing now includes the ability to batch process non-serializable messages, and to stream batch commits. Further, you can now order the execution of batch job instances.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Shared+Resources[Shared Resources]*: Need to share connectors and transaction managers between applications? Shared Resources gives you the ability to share configurations between applications and development teams, including the new Database Connector and the new Bitronix transaction manager.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Scatter-Gather[Scatter-Gather]*:A routing message processor, Scatter-Gather, sends a request message to multiple targets concurrently. It collects the responses from all routes and aggregates them into a single message, but still allows you to implement sequential routing if desired.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Using+the+DataSense+Explorer[DataSense Explorer]*: This feature surfaces information about the Mule message – payload, variables, and properties – as it passes through your flow, relative to the building block you currently have selected on the canvas.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Invoke+Component+Reference[Invoke Message Processor]*: The Invoke message processor is newly exposed in the Studio interface.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Request-Reply+Scope[Request-Reply Scope]*: The Request-Reply scope is newly exposed in the Studio interface.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/FIPS+140-2+Compliance+Support[Support for FIPS 140-2 Compliance]*: Mule now can be configured to run in a FIPS 140-2 certified environment.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Until+Successful+Scope[Synchronous Until-Successful]*: New with 3.5.0, you can configure your until-successful scope to process messages synchronously, relative to your main flow. 
* *link:/documentation/display/current/Analyzing+Flow+Processing+and+Payloads[Enhanced Flow Analyzer in MMC]*: We have enhanced the Flow Analyzer functionality by adding the ability to stop analysis automatically after a period of time. Further, privileged users can stop an ongoing analysis session.
* *Updates to MEL syntax*: Mule supports link:/documentation/display/current/Mule+Expression+Language+Reference#MuleExpressionLanguageReference-DotSyntax[dot syntax] in MEL expressions. In Anypoint Studio, autocomplete supports this dot syntax for all object fields. However, you must use the bracket syntax for map access in cases where the keys are not strings or you need to evaluate an expression to obtain the actual key to use.
* *Jetty Acceptor Threads*: Now exposed in Mule, the Jetty acceptor threads enable tuning to handle larger loads and more clients. 
* *Upgraded HA*: We have upgraded the Hazelcast engine underlying Mule's High Availability clustering and added the ability to run HA clusters in link:/documentation/display/current/Mule+High+Availability+HA+Clusters#MuleHighAvailabilityHAClusters-ClusteringforHighPerformance[performant mode] to prioritize performance over reliability.
* *XSD Validation Improvements*: We have improved the validation of XSDs in Mule applications, offering better validation and helpful error messages.
* *Better Performance with JMS:* Under a high load, use JMS session pooling to obtain better performance. 
* *Performance Improvements in DataMapper and HA:* The architecture of new 3.5.0 components – such as Database Connector, Web Service Consumer, and Scatter-Gather – take into account performance tuning best practices. Use an added Jetty attribute to further tune performance. 
* *OAuth 2.0 Out of the Box*: The OAuth 2.0 provider module is now bundled with the Mule ESB EE runtime. This means API Manager can now apply an OAuth policy against ESB 3.5.0.
* *Deprecation of JDBC endpoint*: With the introduction of the new Database Connector comes the deprecation of its predecessor, the JDBC endpoint. 
* *Deprecation of All flow control:* With the introduction of Scatter-Gather comes the deprecation of the All flow control. +
* *Anypoint Connector DevKit in Studio*: To build your own Anypoint Connector, you can use the link:/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Connector+DevKit[Anypoint Connector DevKit]. In the latest release of Anypoint Studio, you can add a Beta module that enables you to access DevKit functionality directly in Studio. Includes: +
** new Anypoint Connector wizard to easily create new connector projects
** outline view to improve project navigation
** new code templates to facilitate quicker connector development
** DevKit error highlighting as you type
* *link:/documentation/display/current/API+Manager+6.0.X+Release+Notes[API Manager Agent 6.0.0]:* Included in this release, the new agent includes several fixes and improves performance for contract-based policies.
* *link:/documentation/display/current/APIkit[APIkit version 1.3]:* Now included automatically in Studio, the newest version of APIkit includes improved functionality: +
** improved user experience using the RAML Editor
** ability to generate `!include` files from within the RAML Editor
** ability to open the API Console within the Studio console
** ability to create a separate API Console flow to host the console in a separate URI

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Anypoint Studio with 3.5.0 Runtime does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule Studio (December 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013). MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM.

Please mailto:support@mulesoft.com[contact MuleSoft] with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Deprecated in this Release

As Mule ESB evolves, components and APIs are sometimes replaced or superseded by an improved method of implementation. These elements are flagged as deprecated in the product and documentation in order to alert users to the change. This indicates they will continue to function and be supported in the product until the next major release version (4.x, 5.x, 6.x), but users are discouraged from using them and should consider migrating their applications. After the next major release version, they may be removed and no longer supported in the product.

Elements deprecated in the 3.5.0 runtime:

* JDBC endpoint and transport
* All flow control
* Maps to XML transformer
* XML to Maps transformer
* Maps to CSV transformer
* CSV to Maps transformer
* Resultset to Maps transformer
* Service Lookup endpoint

Note that current documentation may still reference these deprecated elements in legacy examples and code snippets for a period of time. These examples are being updated on a rolling basis with the new, recommended best practices and implementations.

=== Anypoint Studio

[cols=",",]
|===
|n/a |Studio and Mavericks: If you are running OS X Mavericks, Studio cannot automatically find your Maven installation, so your home directory field will be blank and the Maven support boxes unchecked. Workaround: To use Maven with Anypoint Studio on Mavericks, configure your Maven home directory manually. Once you have configured a valid Maven home, click Test Maven Configuration to verify your settings.
|STUDIO-4914 |SAP: When unchecking Output XML option it is not possible to get the details or the files for the specified object. They are empty.
|n/a |Maven in Windows: To have good Maven support you need Eclipse to point to a JDK. In Windows by default you need to manually configure the JDK as Eclipse will look for the JRE. 
|STUDIO-4937 |CXF and REST Components: When using CXF or REST Message Processors, you may have some conflicts with the appearance of the response section of the flow on the canvas.
|STUDIO-4980 |Query Builder: This is a Mac-specific issue. The Query Builder UI misbehaves after a DataSense type structure retrieval operation. Workaround: close the Query Builder after the DataSense retrieval and open it again.

== Migration Guide

This section presents configuration considerations you may want to adjust when migrating from a previous version of a Mule runtime, or previous version of Studio. mailto:support@mulesoft.com[Contact MuleSoft] if you have a question about a specific migration activity or concern.

=== Migrating to May 2014 Version

*With Anypoint Studio*: To migrate from *any previous installation of Anypoint Studio*, download and install the May 2014 Enterprise version afresh from http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb[www.mulesoft.com] or the http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[Customer Portal]; follow the instructions to link:/documentation/display/current/Adding+Community+Runtime[add the May 2014 Community Runtime] to your new instance of Studio.

To import existing Mule projects into an instance of Anypoint Studio May 2014 with 3.5.0 Runtime, best practice recommends that you create a new workspace in Anypoint Studio, then import any existing projects into your new workspace.

*Without Anypoint Studio*: To migrate from a previous version of Mule ESB 3.5.0 standalone, download and install the May 2014 Enterprise version afresh from http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/soa/mule-esb-open-source-esb[www.mulesoft.com] or the http://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[Customer Portal]; download the Mule ESB 3.5.0 Community standalone from http://www.mulesoft.org/[www.mulesoft.org].


=== Migrating to 3.5.0 Version of Mule Management Console

The 3.5.0 version of MMC requires migration steps that vary according to the version and setup of the MMC you are migrating from. Please either perform a clean install or follow the steps targeted to your current version in the instructions for link:/documentation/display/current/Upgrading+the+Management+Console[Upgrading the Management Console].

=== Migrating Applications That Use OAuth2 Connectors

[IMPORTANT]
If your 3.3.X or 3.4.X application uses an OAuth2 connector and you migrate to the May 2014 3.5.0 Runtime, you will likely need to adjust the way you use the connector in your application. See details below.

The May 2014 3.5.0 Runtime introduces a new way of conducting OAuth authorization within applications. If your existing application uses an operation-based connector that uses OAuth2 (see table below), and you intend to run the application using the May 2014 3.5.0 Runtime and use the new version of the connector, then you may need to adjust your application. 

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Operation-based Connectors Using OAuth2 |Version with New OAuth Behavior
|Salesforce |5.4.7
|Facebook |2.3.2
|Dropbox | 
|Box | 
|Google Calendars |2.0.0
|Google Contacts |2.0.0
|Google Spreadsheets |2.0.0
|Google Tasks |2.0.0
|===

Previous versions of an OAuth-enabled connector handled OAuth authorization using a token id. The connectors stored each user’s OAuth information – access and refresh tokens, token server urls, etc. – in the object store. Because each user of an application has different OAuth information, each token needed to be assigned an id. This mandated that each time your application needed to execute a protected operation, it needed to specify the id of the token to use, which could be a time-consuming hassle. 

With the above-listed versions of OAuth-enabled connectors, the OAuth support in Mule changed so that, by default, all tokens are stored under a key that matches the *connector’s config name*. http://blogs.mulesoft.org/mule-oauth2-support-even-easier-still/[Read blog example.]

*Best OOTB Practice:* Do not define any expression to fetch token ids, or delete any that you have configured; rather, rely on Mule's default behavior to access the values for the OAuth information according to the connector's config name. Note that this method is useful only if you have a single user with one set of OAuth information.

==== Advanced or Multitenant Applications

As described above, Mule 3.5.0 runtime accesses OAuth token information stored under a key that matches the connector's config name. This default behavior means that you do not have to explicitly configure the connectors in your application to fetch OAuth token information. However, in more complex applications, or those that involve multitenancy, you can override the above-described default behavior using one of two methods described below.

* Each time an OAuth2 protected operation is found (including Authorize), Mule checks to see if the connector in the flow has its own *accessTokenId expression* (an optional attribute). If it is defined, Mule evaluates the expression, then uses the value accordingly.
* If the in-flow connector doesn't provide its own accessTokenId, then Mule uses the *defaultAcessTokenId expression* configured in the global connector. If it is defined, Mule evaluates the expression, then uses the value accordingly.


=== Migration Considerations

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|MULE-6968 |In the previous versions of Mule, when no path was defined on an HTTP endpoint, requests sent to "/" were received; if the path was defined as " " or "/", requests were rejected. With 3.5.0, the HTTP endpoint receives requests if no path was defined, or if the path was defined as " " or "/".
|MULE-7013 |The `keepSendSocketOpen` attribute in the HTTP/S connector is deprecated. Inherited from TCP Connector, this has no effect on outbound HTTP connections and will be removed in the future.
|MULE-7023 |The `keep-alive` attribute in inbound and outbound HTTP/S endpoints is renamed to `keepAlive`.
|MULE-7011 |`org.mule.util.queue.Queue` class now has a `clear()` method to discard all elements in the queue while leaving the queue usable. If you have your own implementation of a Mule Queue, be sure to adjust the configuration to take into account this new behavior.
|MULE-7010 |`ObjectStore` class now has a `clear()` method which discards all elements while leaving the store usable. If you have your own implementation of `ObjectStore`, be sure to adjust the configuration to take into account this new behavior.
|MULE-7090 a|
* Mule uses the default security provider and TLSv1 as the default algorithm for secure socket connections.
* `tlsProtocolHandler` attribute from TLS configuration in SSL, TLS, SMTPS, Jetty HTTPS transports is deprecated and will be ignored. Mule uses the default settings defined in the JVM platform. This parameter is no longer needed in supported JDKs.

|MULE-7061 |Jetty transport now uses Jetty 8. Applications using a custom `jetty.xml` configuration file must update the Jetty classes referenced in this file due to package names changed from version 6 to 7. http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Starting/Porting_to_Jetty_7/Packages_and_Classes[Read more for details].
|MULE-7138 |MD5MuleEventKeyGenerator is now deprecated. The new implementation is: SHA256MuleEventKeyGenerator.
|MULE-7097 a|
A new configuration file, `conf/tls-default.conf`, has been added. This file defines two properties:

* limit the cipher suites
* protocols used by Mule in SSL sockets

|MULE-7103 a|
The new system property, `mule.security.model`, may be used to alter the security setup of Mule and its modules.

* If _not_ defined, or defined with the value `default`, no restrictions apply and Mule reads the TLS configuration from the `conf/tls-default.conf` file.
* If defined with the value `fips140-2`, Mule works with a FIPS compliant security model: any cryptographic modes of operation not approved in the standard will be disabled. (The PGP module will be disabled, and the TLS configuration properties will be read from `conf/tls-fips140-2.conf`). Note that full FIPS compliance also requires a certified JCE provider installed.

|MULE-7390 a|
Out of the box, the following transformers no longer support external entities:

* xslt-transformer
* dom-to-xml-transformer
* xml-to-dom-transformer
* dom-to-output-handler-transformer
* xquery-transformer

For cases in which external entities processing is needed, the attribute `acceptExternalEntities` has been added for optional configuration (defaults to a value of `false`). Use this attribute with extreme caution in cases in which you trust the source only.

|EE-3509 |Instead of MD5, the cache module uses SHA-256 as the hashing function.
|n/a |cacheJmsSessions is deprecated.
|MULE-7425 |xpath() MEL function no longer changes the message payload when a source is provided. For example, the expression xpath('catalog/cd/title') may change the message payload, while xpath('catalog/cd/title', flowVars['xml']) will not.
|MULE-7439 |org.mule.transport.http.servlet.MuleHttpServletResponse.formatDate now receives a StringBuilder instead of a StringBuffer.
|MULE-7428 |The underlying implementation of Mule queues has changed. To revert to previous behaviour you can set system property mule.queue.objectstoremode=true. Old classes were deprecated and moved to package org.mule.util.queue.objectstore.
|MULE-7513 |Attribute secondsBetweenRetries has been deprecated in favor of a new attribute called millisBetweenRetries. This change is backwards compatible. You can still use secondsBetweenRetries although it's not recommended. Setting both attributes at the same time will result in a configuration error.
|MULE-7386 |Class org.mule.module.management.agent.JmxAgent has been renamed to org.mule.module.management.agent.JmxApplicationAgent.
|MULE-7536 |Mule distribution does not provide a lib/shared/default domain for sharing class loading. Now we provide a default Mule domain under domains/default which serves the same purpose and more. You can still use the old shared class loading mechanism by creating the folder lib/shared/default.
|MULE-7524 |Encoded Mule expressions in dynamic endpoints address components are no longer supported.
|MULE-7546 |Implementations of org.mule.api.MuleMessage now need to implement clearAttachments() which was added to the interface. Implementations that extend org.mule.el.context.AbstractMapContext must now implement clear() given this method has been removed from the abstract implementation.
