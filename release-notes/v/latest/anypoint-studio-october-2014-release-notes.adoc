*Enterprise Runtime*

|*ESB Runtime* |Version: 3.5.2
|*Anypoint** Studio* |Version: October 2014
|*Anypoint DevKit* |Version: 3.5.2
|*APIkit* |Version: 1.5.0
|*SAP Connector* |Version: 2.2.4
|===

== New Features and Functionality

This version of Studio may be used with different runtimes. With the latest GA runtime, 3.5.2, the following features are added:

* Added support for JCo 3.0.11 . Upgrading  requires changes in your project structure. Please see the documentation for more details.
* DataSense improvements : APIkit and the Message Properties Transformer are now supported.
* DataMapper now supports JSON schema for describing input and output structures.
* A license is no longer required for running tests with Maven as of Mule 3.5.2 and 3.6.0-M2.  
* Support for Bitronix Transaction Manager

If you install the early access 3.6.0-M2 runtime, projects built with it have access to the following features in Studio:

* HTTP Connector (beta) : Mule 3.6.0-M2 includes a new HTTP connector which makes it easier to connect to RESTful HTTP services. Built in RAML capabilities make it easy to see what resources and methods a service supports and the input and output payloads using DataSense.
* Runtime Launcher (beta) : Studio now includes a new application launcher which allows multiple Mule applications to be run concurrently. To enable it, go to the preferences for Anypoint Studio and check, “Enable new Mule Runtime Launcher (ESB 3.6.0+)”

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Anypoint Studio with 3.5.2 Runtime does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule Studio (December 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (December 2013).

MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM.

Contact MuleSoft with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Important Notes

To run projects that use runtime 3.6.0-M2, you must have JRE version 1.7 installed and selected in Studio, as this runtime is no longer compatible with older versions of Java.

Verify that Studio is using this version of Java by going to *Preferences* > *Java* > *Installed JREs*.

[TIP]
To see a list of depreciated items in 3.6.0 Runtime, see link:/release-notes/mule-esb-3.6.0-release-notes[Mule ESB 3.6.0 Release Notes].

== Migration guide  

This version of Studio only has some bug fixes when used with runtime 3.5.2. Additional beta features (listed above) are only available if you install the 3.6.0-M2 ESB Runtime.

The Normal Update Site mechanism  prompts you to install the updates. If you use the APIkit extension, when upgrading Anypoint Studio you must also update this component.
