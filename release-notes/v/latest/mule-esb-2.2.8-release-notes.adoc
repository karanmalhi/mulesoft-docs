== Support for class hierarchy on the exception patterns

Before you had to explicitly define all the exceptions (or pattern that would match them) in the exception-pattern to commit or rollback a transaction. With this enhancement, you can now use your exception class hierarchy to commit or rollback.

If you want to rollback on any `InvalidRequestException`, on previous versions you had to put in the exception-pattern all exceptions or a pattern that would match them all. Now you can just put `InvalidRequestException` and all the children classes matches it, as now we check if it's an instance of. Here is an example on how you can make this work, by adding a *+* at the end of a fully-qualified exception.

<default-connector-exception-strategy>
<rollback-transaction exception-pattern="java.lang.IllegalArgumentException+"/>
...
</default-connector-exception-strategy>

in Mule ESB.

== Support for Custom JMX Authenticator

Before the JMX Agent only supported simple password authentication (SimplePasswordAuthenticator). Now you can define your own JMX Authenticator on the JMX config like in the example below.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<spring:bean name="customJMXAuthenticator" class="org.mule.management.config.ManagementCustomJMXAuthenticatorTestCase$CustomJMXAuthenticator" />
<management:jmx-default-config jmxAuthenticator-ref="customJMXAuthenticator"/>
----

== Exception Strategy can stop the Service

We added a new property in the default service exception strategy (org.mule.service.DefaultServiceExceptionStrategy) to be able to stop the service to ensure it will not continue processing messages. This is useful in case you want to stop processing messages after a particular exception is thrown (DB server is down for example) to prevent unnecessary load on the server retrying the messages. Once you solved the underlying cause for the exception (start the DB server), you can resume the service through the JMX console. Here is a simple example on how you can achieve this.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<default-service-exception-strategy stopMessageProcessing="true">
...
</default-service-exception-strategy>
----

== Caching of JNDI entry for JMS queue location

We added a way to configure the JNDI resolver to use to look for your JMS queue location. Now you have the `SimpleJndiNameResolver` and the new `CachedJndiNameResolver`. The cache stores the queue location internally and does not try to resolve it every time the queue location is needed. To read more about this visit the
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.2/jms-transport-reference[JMS Transport page].
