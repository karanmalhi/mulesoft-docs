== Migration Information

* From the previous version of Studio 5.1.0, 5.1.1, 5.2.0, 5.2.1 to 5.3.0 there is no special migration needed, but when opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the New Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.

[NOTE]
Studio as an Eclipse plugin only works with Eclipse 4.3 or 4.4 due to an SWT dependency.

== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Anypoint Studio with the 3.7.x Runtime does not change hardware or software requirements.

MuleSoft recommends a minimum of 4GB RAM on a developer workstation. As applications become complex, consider adding more RAM.

This version of Anypoint Studio requires Java 7.
