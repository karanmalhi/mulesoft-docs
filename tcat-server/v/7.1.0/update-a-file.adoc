= Update a File
:keywords: tcat, update, file, put

The PUT operation updates a file on the server relative to CATALINA_BASE. This has exactly the same semantics as POST, except that instead of creating new files, it  returns a 404 status code if the file does not exist. URLs are of the form http://localhost:8080/console/api/servers/73d89173-290e-4cb3-a61c-e11deb74767d/files/<path> where `<path>` is the path of the file you want to update. The request body contains the file.
