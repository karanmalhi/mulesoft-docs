= Get the Deployment History
:keywords: tcat, get, deployment, history, json

The GET operation retrieves links to historical information about the specified deployment when appended with `/history`. Each deployment has a version history. Each individual version contains the applications deployed, the servers deployed to, and the status of the last deployment.

The resulting JSON data format contains two properties: `latestVersion` contains a link to the latest version of the deployment, and `versions` is an array that contains links to the individual deployment version details. These properties can be accessed as described in the deployment history details section below.
