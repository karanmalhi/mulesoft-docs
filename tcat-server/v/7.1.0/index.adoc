== Install Tcat Server on One Machine

This process explains how to *install* the Tcat Server and the Tcat Administration Console on one machine, then use the Console to *manage* the Server and *deploy* a new application.

=== Before You Begin

To run Tcat Server, you need a working installation of the correct version of Java. You have two ways to achieve this – either use a pre-existing installation of Java, or you may select a Tcat Server installer download that contains a bundled Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This second option is only available for some operating systems.

In either of these cases, you need to read this section to determine system requirements.

=== Obtain Installer

Download the Tcat Server installer for Windows (.exe), Linux (.sh), and MacOS (.dmg) from link:http://www.mulesoft.com/download-tcat-server-enterprise-tomcat.
