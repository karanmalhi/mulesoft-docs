= Message Processors

After Mule receives a message from a Message Source, it uses one or more message processors to process the message through a flow.

Message Processors can be categorized by function as follows:

* *Components* are flexible tools which perform business logic implemented in Java and other scripting languages.
* *Filters* only allow certain messages to continue to be processed in a flow.
* *Routers* control message flow to route, re-sequence, or split and aggregate messages in a flow.
* *Scopes* wrap other messages processors so as to enable them to perform together as a group.
* *Transformers* convert message payload type and data format to facilitate communication between systems.
