= HTTP Connector
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, connectors, http, https, http headers, query parameters, rest, raml

The HTTP Connector can send an receive HTTP and HTTPS requests over a selected host, port and address.

Depending on which type of HTTP connector you use, you can either:

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-listener-connector[Listen for HTTP requests] that arrive at a certain address and provide an HTTP response to these
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-request-connector[Send HTTP requests] to a certain address and receive the returned response

Through additional configuration, the connector allows you to:

* Use link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/tls-configuration[TLS] encryption to send or receive *HTTPS* requests 
* Send link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/authentication-in-http-requests[Authenticated Requests], through *Basic Authentication, Digest and OAuth*

In Studio, the HTTP Connector can work in one of two ways, depending on where it's placed on a flow:

* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-listener-connector[HTTP Listener Connector]
* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-request-connector[HTTP Request Connector]

To instance the connector as an HTTP Listener Connector, you must place it into the *Source* section of a flow (ie: as the first element in the flow):

image:add_listener.png[add+listener]

To instance the connector as an HTTP Request Connector, you must place it into the *Process* section of a flow (ie: anywhere except the beginning of it):

image:add+request+connector.png[add+request+connector]

When writing Mule projects in XML, the HTTP Connector can work in one of two ways, depending on how you create it:

* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-listener-connector[HTTP Listener Connector]
* As an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-request-connector[HTTP Request Connector]

To instance the connector as an HTTP Listener Connector, add the following XML tag at the start of a flow:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener config-ref="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" path="/" />
----

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_Configuration" host="localhost" port="8081" />
----

To instance the connector as an HTTP Listener Connector, add the following XML tag in any part of a flow:

[source,xml]
----
<http:request config-ref="HTTP_Request_Configuration" path="/" method="GET" />
----

This element must reference a global configuration element of the following type:


[source,xml]
----
<http:request-config name="HTTP_Request_Configuration" host="example.com" port="8081"/>
----

[TIP]
To migrate a project that uses instances of the old link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-transport-reference[HTTP endpoint-based connector] to the new HTTP operation-based connector, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/migrating-to-the-new-http-connector[Migrating to the New HTTP Connector]. The old HTTP endpoint-based Connector still works with Mule 3.6 Runtime, but it's deprecated and will eventually be removed.

[TIP]
You can edit the log4j2 configuration file to make the logging of the HTTP connector's activity a lot more verbose, if you need to. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/logging-in-mule[Logging in Mule] for instructions.
