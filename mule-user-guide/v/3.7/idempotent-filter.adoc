== Idempotent Message Filter

Ensures that only unique messages are received by a service by checking the unique ID of the incoming message. Note that the ID used can be generated from the message using an expression defined in the `idExpression` attribute. By default, the expression used is `#[message:id]`, which means the underlying endpoint must support unique message IDs for this to work. Otherwise,  `UniqueIdNotSupportedException` is thrown.

|Name|Description
|name|Type: name (no spaces), optional - Identifies the processor so that other elements can reference it. Required if the processor is defined at the global level.
|onUnaccepted |Type: string, optional - Events that are not accepted by the filter are sent to this (optional) named message processor.
|throwOnUnaccepted |Type: boolean, optional - Whether to throw an exception if a message is not accepted
|idExpression |Type: string, optional - Defines one or more expressions to use when extracting the ID from the message. For example, it's possible to combine  headers as the ID of the message to provide idempotency:

[source,code]
----
#[headers:foo,bar]
----

Or, you could combine the message ID with a header:

[source,code]
----
#[message:id]-#[header:foo]
----

If this property is not set, the following is used by default:

[source,code]
----
#[message:id]
