== Introduction

Anypoint Connector for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) provides real-time connectivity to query and update Oracle EBS using web services and message queues. The connector has been developed for the Oracle EBS v12.1.x. For more information about Oracle EBS, visit link:http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/ebusiness/overview/index.html[Oracle site].

*Release Notes:* link:/release-notes/oracle-e-business-suite-ebs-connector-release-notes[Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) Connector Release Notes]

Oracle EBS connector provides integration to the following:

* *Financial Management and Order Management Modules*: Full API coverage for Financials and Order Management services.
* *PL/SQL Integration*: Both standard PL/SQL or user-defined PL/SQL can be invoked.
* *XML Gateway*: Inbound and Outbound, to send and receive message to and from EBS.
* *Business Events*: The ability to receive messages when an event is fired in EBS.

== Prerequisites

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with Oracle EBS, this document assumes you have:

* A working knowledge of Oracle EBS.
* Read the relevant documentation on Web Services and Integration Scenarios for your Oracle EBS version.

[TIP]
A definition and detailed explanation of the Oracle EBS terms and concepts used here are freely available in the Oracle documentation set of your Oracle installation.

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors], and link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/basic-studio-tutorial[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/elements-in-a-mule-flow[Mule flows] and link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/global-elements[Mule Global Elements].

To use the Oracle EBS connector, you must have the following:

* *Java 7*: Oracle EBS connector does not work unless you are using Java 1.7.0_x as your JRE 
* *Web service configuration in Oracle EBS*: Configuring the Oracle EBS connector requires configuring web services in Oracle EBS and exposing them via the Integration Repository
* *FND_WEB_SEC PL/SQL Service*: The connector requires Oracle EBS to have the FND_WEB_SEC PL/SQL service deployed
* *Anypoint Studio*

== Compatibility

Oracle EBS Connector 1.0 is compatible with:

[width="100%",cols="50a,50a",options="header",]
|===
|Application/Service|Version
|*Mule Runtime* |3.6 or higher
|*Anypoint Studio* |5.2.1 or higher
|*Oracle EBS* |12.1.x
|*Java* |7
|===

[IMPORTANT]
Please note that this connector only supports EBS version 12.1.x with SOA Gateway. Due to licensing changes by Oracle, version 12.2.x does not ship with SOA Gateway and will not work with this connector.

== Connector Architecture

Oracle EBS offers different technologies or products to address various types of integrations. Listed below are the most widely used for integration with enterprise applications:

. Data-centric integration.
. Event-driven integration using Oracle Business Event System and XML Gateway queues.
. Integration through Web Services using Integrated SOA gateway.

The following illustration shows the integration architecture of the MuleSoft Oracle EBS connector:

== Using the Connector

Use the Oracle EBS connector as a message source if you wish to *subscribe to queues*, or as an operation-based connector, if your goal is to *invoke web service operations*.

=== Subscribing to a Queue or a Topic

* To *subscribe to a queue or topic* (such as the XML Gateway Outbound queue or the Business Events topic), you need to drag the connector to the "Source" section of your flow. After doing so, and selecting a Connector Configuration, you will have to choose the queue/topic you wish to subscribe to, from the *Operation* dropdown.

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Drag a new Flow scope element onto the canvas.
. Add an Oracle EBS connector as an Inbound endpoint at the beginning of the flow.
. Drag a Logger to the Process section of the flow.
. Configure the connector's parameters according to the table below.
+
image:oracle_ebs_config_source_2.png[oracle_ebs_config_source_2]
+
[cols=",",]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Display Name* |Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|*Connector Configuration* |Connect to a global element linked to this connector. Global elements encapsulate reusable data about the connection to the target resource or service. Select the global Oracle EBS connector element that you just created.
|*Operation* |Select the queue or topic you wish to subscribe to from the dropdown. In this example, we will select Business Events, but you could also pick XML Gateway Outbound.
|===
. Click the blank space on the canvas to save your configurations.

=== Invoking a Web Service Operation

* To *invoke a web service operation*, you must drag the connector to the "Process" section of your flow and fill in its input parameters. If the operation you need to invoke is a PL/SQL function exposed as a web service, select the *Invoke PL/SQL* Operation, and then make a selection from the *PL/SQL* and *Function* dropdown menus that appear in the General tab.

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio.
. Add a suitable Mule Inbound endpoint, such as the HTTP listener or File endpoint, to begin the flow.
. Drag the Oracle EBS connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the connector's parameters according to the table below.
+
image:oracle_ebs_config.png[oracle_ebs_config]
+
[cols=",",]
|===
|*Field* |*Description*
|*Display Name* |Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
|*Connector Configuration* |Connect to a global element linked to this connector. Global elements encapsulate reusable data about the connection to the target resource or service. Select the global Oracle EBS connector element that you just created.
|*Operation* |Select the operation from the dropdown. You can select any of the operations displayed or the *Invoke PL/SQL* operation, which allows you to execute a web service published from PL/SQL.
|*Params* |Complete the parameters needed for the operation selected. If the *Invoke PL/SQL* operation is selected, you need to select the *PL/SQL* and *Function* parameters with an operation to be executed.
|===
. Click the blank space on the canvas to save your configurations.
. If you select the *Invoke PL/SQL* operation, you need to add a *Transform Message* transformer to map the values from the flow to the input parameters for the PL/SQL operation.
