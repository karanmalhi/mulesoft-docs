[NOTE]
DataMapper will continue to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule ESB 3.x, however it will be removed in Mule 4.0. We recommend that if you wish to take advantage of the new capabilities of link:https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/DataWeave[DataWeave] or if you start new projects, upgrade now. However, if you have no pressing need to take advantage of new functionality, we recommend you wait until Mule 4.0 is released.

*Anypoint DataMapper*, or DataMapper for short, is a Mule transformer that delivers simple, yet powerful, visual design of complex data transformations for use in Mule flows, including:

* Extraction and loading of flat and structured data formats
* Filtering, extraction and transformation of input data using XPath and powerful scripting
* Augmenting data with input parameters and lookups from other data sources
* Live design-time previews of transformation results
* High-performance, scalable data mapping operations

Inputs and outputs can be “flat” (that is, row-structured) data like CSV files or Excel spreadsheet data, or structured data in the formats supported throughout Mule: XML, JSON, key/value Maps and trees of Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).

In general, using the more basic Mule transformers to recreate the functionality of a single DataMapper may require a complex flow of format converters for input data, splitters, filters, For Each scopes, expressions, other transformers, aggregators, and yet more format converters for the output. A DataMapper-based implementation is faster to implement and e asier to maintain than the alternatives.

Graphical design of the complex transformations supported by DataMapper makes it simple to apply all of its capabilities with little coding beyond basic expressions and function calls to transform data.

[NOTE]
====
*Full DataMapper functionality is exclusive to the Mule ESB Enterprise Edition (EE),* it won't work if you're deploying your projects to Mule ESB Community Edition (CE).
