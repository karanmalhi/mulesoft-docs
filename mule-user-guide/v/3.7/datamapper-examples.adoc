[NOTE]
DataMapper will continue to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule ESB 3.x, however it will be removed in Mule 4.0. We recommend that if you wish to take advantage of the new capabilities of link:https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/DataWeave[DataWeave] or if you start new projects, upgrade now. However, if you have no pressing need to take advantage of new functionality, we recommend you wait until Mule 4.0 is released.

Many of the advanced capabilities of Anypoint DataMapper are best understood through examples. This page lists examples that illustrate using DataMapper in common but complex use cases.
