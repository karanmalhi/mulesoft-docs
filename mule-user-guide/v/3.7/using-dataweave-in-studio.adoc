#*_Enterprise_*#

Anypoint Studio provides a powerful environment to develop Mule applications using DataWeave. It fully supports DataSense, allowing you to leverage metadata from connectors, schemas and sample documents to more easily design your transformations. DataSense provides content assist while you are coding and scaffolds your mappings to help make writing transformations fast and easy.

== Using the DataWeave Transformer

In Anypoint Studio, you can place a *Transform Message* element in a flow to create transformations using the DataWeave language. The editor helps you do this by offering intelligent autocomplete suggestions, an output preview that is updated in real time as you make changes, and by building an initial scaffolding for your code, based on the available metadata in your flow.  This generates a *`.dwl`* transformation file (or several of them) that stores your code and is packaged with your Mule application.

When adding a Transform Message element to a Mule Flow, it takes the elements from the incoming Mule Message as its inputs. It then performs the necessary actions to produce a Mule message as output for the next element in the flow.

When creating a new transformation, it's a lot easier if you first add and configure any other elements on your flow that expose metadata. In this way, this metadata that other message processors expose to Studio is used by the DataWeave transformer to automatically generate a scaffolding for your transformation file. This scaffolding already includes much of what you need to define, serving as a good starting point for you to build upon.

=== The DataWeave Text Editor GUI


The Transform Message element allows you to freely write link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/dataweave[DataWeave] code.


If you click on an instance of the Transform Message element in your flow, its properties editor will be displayed. This editor is divided into three sections:

* Input
* Transform
* Output

image:new_weave.png[new weave]

==== Input Section

In the main tab, a tree view shows the known metadata contents of the incoming Mule Message, allowing you to explore it and know what data is available for using as an input, and how to reference each part of it.

If there is any metadata about the incoming message, a tab is added for each known component in the metadata. Each of these tabs provides a space where sample data for this input can be provided. This sample data is used together with your DataWeave code to produce a sample output in the output section, which gets updated in real time as you make changes.

If the Mule flow doesn't expose Metadata about the elements you need from the incoming message, you can manually specify it. To do so, select the element of the input you desire to define,  note that the pencil icon at the top right is no longer grayed out. Click this icon to open a new tab in your input section where you can define a sample with the structure of this data.

You can then define the data structure manually by writing or pasting a sample into the newly created tab.

image:input_payload_2.png[image]

When the input is of JSON or XML types, the sample input contains plain XML or JSON code. When the input is of type POJO or DataWeave, the sample input is written in DataWeave for more simplicity. In these cases the sample DataWeave code is merely a way to display the sample data, not a transformation in itself.

==== Setting Reader Parameters

Some input formats, like CSV, allow you to define a reader with specific properties that make DataWeave parse inputs differently. Select the input element you wish to configure on the tree view of the input section, then click the gear icon.

image:edit_input_reader1.png[image]

[TIP]
This option will be grayed out if the type of the input doesn't allow for this kind of configuration. If the payload is of type `unknown`, you must change its type too. Do this by configuring the elements that come your Transform Data element in the flow, for example configuring an HTTP Listener Connector's metadata tab so that it explicitly declares that it outputs CSV data.

You can assign any special character as the indicator for separating fields, toggling quotes, or escaping quotes. Make sure you know what special characters are being used in your input, so that DataWeave can interpret it correctly.

==== Transform Section


In this section, you write the actual link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/dataweave[DataWeave] code that carries out the transform. Notice that changing the type of your output directive changes the output section of the editor. Although DataWeave as a language supports adding input directives and naming these by any name you like, in Studio the elements of the input message are implicitly considered input directives and so they don't need to be defined in the header.

If Studio has any metadata about the components that are upstream or downstream from your  Transform Message element at the time when you add the component to your flow, a scaffolding for your  DataWeave code is written out automatically, with as much depth as Studio can intelligently deduce. In some cases, this code may be enough to carry out the transformation you need, and no additional coding is needed. Sometimes, all you need to do is fill in the blank spaces in the scaffolding with references to the input fields, other times you may want to carry out more complex operations that involve aggregation, filtering, calculations, defining custom functions, etc and there you must write this out in DataWeave code.

For further reference about writing DataWeave code, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/dataweave-reference-documentation[DataWeave Language Reference]


===== Re-scaffolding

Once you've added the *Transform Message* element to your flow, any further changes you make to the surrounding message processors and their metadata won't affect your `.dw`l file. You may still click the Scaffolding button on the top left of the DataWeave properties editor any time you want and have a new scaffolding built, note that this will erase anything you've written in the DataWeave body.  Doing this won't affect any directives you defined in your header (except for the output directive). Use this button if you've made any changes to elements that come after the Transform Message element on the flow that expose metadata and don't mind loosing what you've already written into the transform's body.

image:new_outputdw.png[image]

===== Referencing Existing Transforms

Instead of defining a new `.dwl` file, you can reference an existing one by clicking the *Data Source* button, selecting *On File* as the source and referencing the correct file.

image:use_existing.png[image]

In the XML editor you can do the same by adding a `resource` attribute.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dw:transform-message>
            <dw:set-payload resource="classpath:path/transform.dwl"/>
</dw:transform-message> 
----

===== Handling Multiple Outputs

A single Transform Message element can give shape to several different components of the output Mule message. Each of these output components must be defined in a separate `.dwl` file, written out in a separate tab of the Transform section. For example in one tab you may be defining the payload contents, in another those of an outbound property, and these will both be parts of the same output Mule message.

To add a new output, click the *Plus* sign at the bottom right of the section:new+output.png[image]

A new tab will then appear, there you can specify where in the output Mule message to place the output of this DataWeave transform. In case you're creating a new variable or property, you must also set a name for it.

image:new_output2dw.png[image]

In the XML editor you can do the same by adding multiple child elements inside the `dw:transform-message` component.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dw:transform-message>
            <dw:set-payload resource="classpath:path/transform.dwl"/>
            <dw:set-variable variableName="myVariable" resource="classpath:path/transform.dwl"/>
            <dw:set-session-variable variableName="mySessionVariable" resource="classpath:path/transform.dwl"/>
</dw:transform-message>
----


==== Output Section

This section has two tabs, one of them shows you a neat expandable tree view of the output data structure, the other shows you a preview of what the actual output looks like, built from any sample data you provide in the input section. As you make changes in the transport section, notice how the data structure changes. The output of the transformer is made into the selected component of the output mule message.  If your transformer has multiple outputs, the *Preview* tab will display the one corresponding to the currently selected transform.

If there's any syntax error in the transport section, error notifications are displayed in the output section, as no actual output is produced.

== Using DataWeave Language Elsewhere

All components in Mule that support link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language] also support expressions written in DataWeave Language. To invoke an expression written in DataWeave language, simply invoke the `dw()` function, the expression will return whatever the transform outputs.

DataWeave expressions defined within this function work just as those defined within a Transform Message element, the only difference is that the output is returned into the expression's result, wherever it may be.

For example, you can define a custom object and populate it with elements from the payload:

[source,code]
----
dw(myobject:{id:payload.accountid, user:payload.user})
----

That same expression could be added inside a Logger, within a MEL expression, to print out its result:

[source,code]
----
#[dw(myobject:{id:payload.accountid, user:payload.user})]
----

== Parsing CSV Inputs

When using DataWeave in Anypoint Studio, it's not necessary to declare any input directives for any of the components of the Mule Message that arrives to the DataWeave transformer (Payload, flow variables and input/outbound properties) nor for any system variables. These are already implicitly recognized as inputs and can be referenced anywhere in the DataWeave body without a need to include them in the header, their type is known from Mule metadata.

When defining an input of type CSV, there are a few optional parameters you can add to the input directive to customize how the data will be parsed.

* `header`: boolean that defines if the first line in the data contains headers
* `separator`: character that separates fields, `','` by default
* `quote`: character that defines quoted text, `" "` by default
* `escape`: character that escapes quotes, `/` by default

[NOTE]
====
When `header=true` you can then access the fields within the input anywhere by name. Ex: `in0.userName`.

When `header=false` you must access the fields by index, referencing first the entry and then the field, Ex: `in0[107][2]`
====

You can set these propertes by either editing the XML code or via the UI:

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....

In Anypoint Studio, there are two ways to set this up. You can either set the parameters of the CSV input through the Transform Message component itself or by setting it up on the component of your Mule flow that actually brings this information in.

On the Transform Message component, select the element from the tree view in the input section and then click the gear icon, there you'll be able to configure these properties.

On the component that brings the input into the flow (eg: an HTTP Connector, FTP Connector, etc), select it, pick the `Metadata` tab, and click `Add Metadata` to provide the details about the incoming data structure.

....
[tab,title="XML Editor"]
....

In the XML editor, if you want to parse CSV inputs with custom modifiers, you must set these up as child elements of the dataweave component, like in the example below:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<dw:input-payload doc:sample="list_csv.csv" mimeType="text/csv" >
    <dw:reader-property name="separator" value="|"/> 
    <dw:reader-property name="header" value="false"/> 
</dw:input-payload>
----

....
------


[NOTE]
CSV inputs with multiple lines in their headers are not supported by DataWeave

== Calling Global MEL Functions from DataWeave Code

If you define a global link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language] (MEL) function in your Mule project, you can then invoke it anywhere in your DataWeave code, without need for any special syntax.

To create one such global function, you must edit your Mule project's XML file and enclose any functions that you wish to define in the following set of tags, which must be placed in the global elements section, before any of the flows are defined.

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<configuration doc:name="Configuration">
     <expression-language>
         <global-functions>

         </global-functions>
     </expression-language>
 </configuration>
----


In this space you can use any MEL expression to define custom functions, for example:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<configuration doc:name="Configuration">
     <expression-language>
         <global-functions>
             def newUser() {
                 return ["name" : "mariano"]
             }
             def upperName(user) {
                 return user.name.toUpperCase()
             }
         </global-functions>
     </expression-language>
 </configuration>
----


With that in place, in the DataWeave code of your Transform Message element you can just refer to these functions. Note that the inputs and outputs of these functions can even be objects and arrays.

[source, ruby, linenums]
----
%dw 1.0
%output application/json
---
{
  "foo" :  newUser(),
  "bar":  upperName(newUser())
}
----


Even with these external functions in place, you should be able to preview the output of this transform, updated in real time as you edit it.


== Known Issues and Limitations

* As scaffoldings in the Transform Message element are built automatically based on the required output, when the required output has a very large structure, the building of this entire structure in DataWeave code might take the editor a long time. A way to make this optional or limited in such cases needs to be provided.
