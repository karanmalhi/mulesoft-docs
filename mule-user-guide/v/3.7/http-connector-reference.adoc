Mule Utilities for HTTP Services.

This page serves as a reference for all of the supported attributes and child elements of the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-connector[HTTP Connector].


== Listener

Listener for incoming HTTP requests.

=== Attributes of <listener...>

[width="100%",cols="20%,20%,20%,20%,20%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|path |string |yes |  |Path were to listen for incoming request.
|allowedMethods |string |no |  |Comma separated list of allowed HTTP methods by this listener. To allow all methods do not defined the attribute.
|config-ref |string |yes |  |A reference to the configuration element for this listener. If no reference is provided, a default configuration will be created.
|responseStreamingMode |enumeration |no |AUTO |Defines if the response should be sent using streaming or not. If this attribute is not present, the behavior will depend on the type of the payload (it will stream only for InputStream). If set to true, it will always stream. If set to false, it will never stream. As streaming is done the response will be sent user Transfer-Encoding: chunked.
|parseRequest |string |no |  |By default, the request will be parsed (for example, a multi part request will be mapped as a Mule message with null payload and inbound attachments with each part). If this property is set to false, no parsing will be done, and the payload will always contain the raw contents of the HTTP request.

=== Child Elements of <listener...>

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|response-builder |0..1 |Contains the definition of all the parameters that should be sent in the response (headers, status code, response phrase).

== Listener config

Grouping configuration for a set of listener elements.

=== Attributes of <listener-config...>

[width="100%",cols="20%,20%,20%,20%,20%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|name |name (no spaces) |yes |  |Identifies the configuration in the registry, so that it can be referenced by the request message processor.
|protocol |httpProtocol |no |HTTP |Protocol to use for communication. Valid values are HTTP and HTTPS. Default value is HTTP. When using HTTPS the HTTP communication is going to be secured using TLS / SSL. If HTTPS was configured as protocol then the user needs to configure at least the keystore in the tls:context child element of this listener-config.
|host |string |yes |  |Host where the requests will be sent.
|port |integer |no |  |Port where the requests will be received. If the protocol attribute is HTTP (default) then the default value is 80, if the protocol attribute is HTTPS then the default value is 443.
|basePath |string |no |  |Base path to use for all requests that reference this config.
|tlsContext-ref |string |no |  |Reference to a TLS config element. This will enable HTTPS for this config.
|parseRequest |string |no |  |By default, the request will be parsed (for example, a multi part request will be mapped as a Mule message with null payload and inbound attachments with each part). If this property is set to false, no parsing will be done, and the payload will always contain the raw contents of the HTTP request.
|connectionIdleTimeout |integer |no |30000 |The number of milliseconds that a connection can remain idle before it is closed. The value of this attribute is only used when persistent connections are enabled.
|usePersistentConnections |boolean |no |true |If false, each connection will be closed after the first request is completed.

|source |string |no |  |The expression used to obtain the body that will be sent in the request. Default is empty, so the payload will be used as the body.
|target |string |no |#[payload] |The enricher expression used to enrich the current message with the body of the response. Default is "#[payload]", so after processing the response, the contents of its body will be set as payload of the message.
|followRedirects |boolean |no |  |Specifies whether to follow redirects or not. Default value is true.
|host |string |no |  |Host where the requests will be sent.
|port |integer |no |  |Port where the requests will be sent. If the protocol attribute is HTTP (default) then the default value is 80, if the protocol attribute is HTTPS then the default value is 443.
|parseResponse |boolean |no |true |By default, the response will be parsed (for example, a multi part response will be mapped as a Mule message with null payload and inbound attachments with each part). If this property is set to false, no parsing will be done, and the payload will always contain the raw contents of the HTTP response.
|requestStreamingMode |enumeration |no |AUTO |Defines if the request should be sent using streaming or not. If this attribute is not present, the behavior will depend on the type of the payload (it will stream only for InputStream). If set to true, it will always stream. If set to false, it will never stream. As streaming is done the request will be sent user Transfer-Encoding: chunked.
|sendBodyMode |enumeration |no |AUTO |Defines if the request should contain a body or not. If AUTO, it will depend on the method (GET, HEAD and OPTIONS will not send a body).
|responseTimeout |integer |no |  |Maximum time that the request element will block the execution of the flow waiting for the HTTP response. If this value is not present, the default response timeout from the Mule configuration will be used.
