= Defining Metadata Using Edit Fields
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, datasense, metadata, meta data, query metadata, dsql, data sense query language


When defining or updating input and output metadata for the different data types supported by Anypoint DataMapper, you will use one of several very similar editors to create the structure and define fields, elements and attributes. Any of these editors is opened by selecting *Edit Structure...*.

This document describes the use of the editor for key/value maps. The editors for other structured data are substantially similar, and the editors for flat data like CSV files are similar but simplified. 

[NOTE]
====
DataMapper will continue to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule ESB 3.x, however it will be removed in Mule 4.0 in favour of the *Transform Message* component (based on link:https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/DataWeave[DataWeave] code). We recommend that if you wish to take advantage of the new capabilities of DataWeave or if you start new projects, upgrade now.

A link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/dataweave-migrator[migration tool] is now included in Studio, which assists in converting a DataMapper map to DataWeave. Right click on a DataMapper, select *Migrate to DataWeave*, and follow the instructions.

This document assumes the reader is familiar with the DataMapper Transformer. Consult the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference[DataMapper User Guide and Reference] document for details.

== About the Examples

The illustrations used in this document are taken from the discussion "Shortcut: Creating Output Metadata based on Defined Input Metadata" in link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/defining-datamapper-input-and-output-metadata[Defining DataMapper Input and Output Metadata]. If you want to reproduce the tasks described here, follow the steps in the example in that discussion to set up your environment.

[TIP]
====
You can edit data structure definitions (i.e. fields) in an _existing_ DataMapper transformer within the *Input* and *Output* panes of its DataMapper View. Consult link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/updating-metadata-in-an-existing-mapping[Updating Metadata in an Existing Mapping] for details.

== Adding a Field

. Click `contacts` to select the parent element for the new field. (This step does not apply when working with flat data like CSV or fixed width files.)

. Click the

* Click to select the field, then press the red "X" icon in the upper-left corner of the editor panel.

* Click to select the field, then press *Delete* (not *Backspace*). (On a Mac keyboard, press *fn*+*delete*.)

== Changing the Order of Fields
