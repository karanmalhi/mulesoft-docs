== Running Studio on a Mac

If you're using Mac OS, there are two extra considerations when running Anypoint Studio.

*Java Runtime Environment*

Check to confirm that the Java runtime environment 7 or 8 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: `java -version`

The JDK 7 response should appear similar to:

[source, code, linenums]
----
java version "1.7.0_55"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_55-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.55-b03, mixed mode)
----

The JDK 8 response is similar to:

[source, code, linenums]
----
java version "1.8.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_51-b16)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.51-b03, mixed mode)
----

If a Java runtime environment is _not_ installed, the command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK 7 or 8.

*Application Execution*

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. (Note: you must have Administrator privileges to adjust the security settings.)

. On your Mac, open *System Preferences*, then navigate to *Security & Privacy*.

. In the *General* tab, under "Allow applications downloaded from:", select the radio button for *Anywhere*.

== Downloading Enterprise Additions

If you are running *Anypoint Studio* with an *Enterprise runtime*, you can add additional modules to your Studio instance.
