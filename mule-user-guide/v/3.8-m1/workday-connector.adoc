The Anypoint Connector for Workday is a closed source Enterprise connector which provides a connection between Workday and third party software. It implements the Workday v25.0 API modules, and interfaces with the Human Capital Management, Financial Management, Student, and System web services. The Workday connector is a SOAP based connector developed with DevKit 3.7.1.

*Release Notes*: link:/release-notes/workday-connector-release-notes[Workday Connector Release Notes]

*Migration Guide*: link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/workday-connector-6.0-migration-guide[Workday Connector 6.0 Migration Guide]

== Prerequisites

To use this connector, you need:

* A Workday instance with the necessary permissions
* A set of valid credentials, including username, password, tenant name, and host name (optional). The service endpoints are automatically generated based on the credentials.
* A MuleSoft Enterprise License

This document assumes that you are familiar with Mule,
link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors], and
link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/basic-studio-tutorial[Basic Studio Tutorials]. This page assumes you understand link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/mule-concepts[Mule Concepts], link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/elements-in-a-mule-flow[Elements in a Mule Flow], and link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/global-elements[Global Elements].

Here you can find implementation examples within the context of Anypoint Studio, Mule ESB’s graphical user interface, and, also configuration details for doing the same in the XML Editor.

== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing

You can install a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in
link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-exchange#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange]. However, to use the Workday connector 7.0 in a production environment, you must have an Enterprise license to use Mule.  Contact the link:mailto:info@mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Sales Team] to obtain either of these. Read more about link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/installing-an-enterprise-license[Installing an Enterprise License].

=== Upgrading from an Older Version

. Uninstall the previous Workday Connectors.
. Install the Workday Connector as described in the previous section.
. Make sure you have updated the Maven dependencies correctly:
+
[width="100a",cols="34a,33a,33a",options="header",]
|===
|Connector Version |From |To
|Version until 4.0.1 |`<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>` +
`<artifactId>mule-module-workday</artifactId>` |`<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>` +
`<artifactId>workday-connector</artifactId>`
|Versions 4.0.1 to 6.0 or above |`<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>` +
`<artifactId>mule-module-workday-<wd_module_name></artifactId>` |`<groupId>org.mule.modules</groupId>` +
`<artifactId>workday-connector</artifactId>`
|===
+
. It is important to update the flows to: +
.. Update the existing data mappings
.. Replace the old Workday connector with the newer connector
.. Replace the phased out or deprecated operations
. Make the following changes to the namespace:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|From |To
|*Namespace:* +
 `xmlns:wd-staffing="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-staffing"` +
 *Schema Location:* +
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-staffing +
 http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-staffing/2.0/mule-wd-%3Cwd_module_name%3E.xsd[http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-staffing/2.0/mule-wd-<wd_module_name>.xsd] |*Namespace:* +
 `xmlns:wd-connector="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-connector"` +
 *Schema Location:* +
 http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-connector +
 http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-connector/current/mule-wd-connector.xsd
|===

=== Creating a New Project

To use the Workday connector 7.0 in a Mule application project:

. In Studio, select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
+
image:wd6_filenew.png[wd6_filenew]
+
. Enter a name for your new project and leave the remaining options with their default values. 
. If you plan to use Git, select *Create a .gitignore file* for the project with default ignores for Studio Projects, and then click *Next*.
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

== Configuring the Global Element

To use the Workday connector in your Mule application, you must configure a global Workday element that can be used by all the Workday connectors in the application (read more about  link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/global-elements[Global Elements].) The Workday connector now offers two global configuration types:

* *Configuration*: This configuration requires the following credentials: *Username* (without the tenant name), *Password*, *Tenant Name*, and *Host Name*. Starting from version 6.0 of the connector, the service endpoints are automatically generated by the connector.
* *Advanced Configuration*: Apart from what is available in the above configuration, the advanced configuration supports a user-defined HTTP Request Configuration which enables the user to adjust both the *Connection Idle Timeout* and *Response Timeout* and set up a proxy connection.

[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....

. Click the *Global Elements* tab at the base of the canvas.
. On the Global Mule Configuration Elements screen, click *Create*.
. In the Choose Global Type wizard, expand *Connector Configuration*, and then select *Workday: Basic* or  *Workday: Advanced*, depending on your Workday implementation.
. Click  *OK*
. Enter the global element properties.
.. For *Workday: Basic* Configuration:
+
image:wd7-global-element-properties.png[wd7_global_elements]
+
[width="100a",cols="50a,50a",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name for the configuration to reference it later
|*Username* |Enter the username to log in to Workday.
|*Password* |Enter the corresponding password.
|*Tenant Name* |Enter the Workday Tenant ID. It usually has the suffix "pt_1" appended to it, such as "acme_pt1".
|*Host Name* |Enter the host name of one of the Workday Cloud Servers. By default, the connector sets the host name to `impl-cc.workday.com`.
|===
+
[NOTE]
====
In the Global Element Properties image, the placeholder values refer to a configuration file in the `src` folder of your project. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/configuring-properties[Configuring Properties]. Either enter your credentials in the global configuration properties, or reference a configuration file containing these values.

For simpler maintenance and better re-usability of your project, Mule recommends that you use a configuration file. Keeping these values in a separate file is useful if you need to deploy to different environments, such as production, development, and QA, where your access credentials differ. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/deploying-to-multiple-environments[Deploying to Multiple Environments] for instructions on how to manage this.
====
+
.. For *Workday: Advanced* Configuration:
+
[width="100a",cols="50a,50a",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Name* |Enter a name of the configuration to reference it later
|*Requester Config* |Enter an HTTPRequester configuration.
|*Username* |Enter the username to log in to Workday.
|*Password* |Enter the corresponding password.
|*Tenant Name* |Enter the Workday Tenant ID. It is usually appended with pt_1, such as "acme_pt1".
|*Host Name* |Enter the host name of one of the Workday Cloud Servers. By default, the connector sets the host name to `impl-cc.workday.com`.
|===
. Keep the *Pooling Profile* and the *Reconnection* tabs with their default entries.
. Click *OK* to save the global connector configurations.

To configure the Workday global element:

. Ensure you have included the following namespace in your configuration file:
+
[source,xml]
----
xmlns:wd-connector="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/wd-connector"
----
. Create a global Workday configuration outside and above your flows, using the following global configuration code:
+
[source,xml]
----
<wd-connector:config name="Workday_Connector__Configuration" username="${workday.username}" password="${workday.password}" tenantName="${workday.tenantname}" doc:name="Workday Connector: Configuration"/>
----
