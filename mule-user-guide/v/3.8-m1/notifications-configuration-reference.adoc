== Notifications

Registers listeners for notifications and associates interfaces with particular events.

=== Attributes of Notifications

[cols=",",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Description
|`dynamic` |If the notification manager is dynamic, listeners can be registered dynamically at runtime via the MuleContext, and the configured notification can be changed. Otherwise, some parts of Mule cache notification configurations for efficiency and do not generate events for newly enabled notifications or listeners. +
*Type*: `boolean` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `false`

=== Child Elements of Notifications

[cols=",",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|`notification` |0..* |Associates an event with an interface. Listeners that implement the interface receives instances of the event.
|`disable-notification` |0..* |Blocks the association of an event with a particular interface. This filters events after the association with a particular interface (and so takes precedence).
|`notification-listener` |0..* |Registers a bean as a listener with the notification system. Events are dispatched by reflection - the listener receives all events associated with any interfaces it implements. The relationship between interfaces and events is configured by the notification and disable-notification elements.

=== Attributes of disable-notification

[cols=",",options="header"]
|===
|Name |Description

*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`event` |The event you no longer want to deliver. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`interface-class` |The interface (class name) that no longer receives the event. +
*Type*: `class name` +

|`interface` |The interface that no longer receives the event. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|===

No child elements for `disable-notification`.

== Notification Listener

Registers a bean as a listener with the notification system. Events are dispatched by reflection - the listener
receives all events associated with any interfaces it implements. The relationship between
interfaces and events is configured by the notification and disable-notification elements.

== Notification Types

You can specify the following types of notifications using the `event` attribute of the `<notification>` and `<disable-notification>` element:

* ASYNC-MESSAGE
* COMPONENT-MESSAGE
* CONNECTION
* CONTEXT
* CUSTOM
* ENDPOINT-MESSAGE
* EXCEPTION
* EXCEPTION-STRATEGY
* MANAGEMENT
* MESSAGE-PROCESSOR
* MODEL
* PIPELINE-MESSAGE
* REGISTRY
