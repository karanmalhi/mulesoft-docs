= Mule Deployment Model
:keywords: anypoint studio, esb, deploy, architecture

When you build a Mule Project on Anypoint Studio, or outside of it, and then deploy it, Mule deploys a *Mule Application*. Mule supports multiple applications running independently within the same Mule container. This allows additional advantages such as:

* Running multiple applications side-by-side
* Clear boundaries for operations on what a Mule application is
* Mule can monitor your applications and will reload configuration changes automatically
* Applications can depend on different library versions, even if they would conflict before
* Multiple versions of an application can exist side by side

Every application is deployed together with a *Domain*. By default, your application references the default domain, and no further configuration is required. You can see that it gets deployed together with the app in the console:

If you're deploying multiple applications to the same place, and those applications could share the same resources, then you can create a common *domain* where you can define common configurations that can then be referenced by multiple projects. This allows you to, for example, expose different services in different projects through the same HTTP host and port and be able to deploy everything without any conflicts. link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/shared-resources[Read More].

Understanding the deployment model can be divided into several topics:
