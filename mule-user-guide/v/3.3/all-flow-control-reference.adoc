= All Flow Control Reference

*Purpose:* Sends the same message to multiple target message processors.

*Minimum Configuration:* None.

*Discussion:* Use the All Flow Control to route or broadcast the same message to more than one processor component.

In many cases, All sends messages to endpoints. If the endpoint has a filter associated to it, then the message must pass through the filtering criteria in order for the endpoint to receive it.

If the targets receiving messages from the All Flow Control also return messages, then these return messages, if any, are aggregated together and collectively form the response.
