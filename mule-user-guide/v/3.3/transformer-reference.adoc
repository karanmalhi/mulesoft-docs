= Transformer Ref

*Purpose:* References a transformer defined as a global element.

*Minimum Configuration:* The global name of the transformer.

*Discussion:* A Transformer Ref is a quick way to reference a previously created global Transformer element. You create a global Transformer element from the Global Elements pane. 

Click the General tab and set the Transformer Reference property to the global transformer name. The global Transformer must have already been created and you select its name from the pull-down list.
