= Using Outbound Endpoints to Publish Data

This example shows how to use outbound endpoints in Mule. Outbound endpoints are useful for publishing data to a flow, application, or resource.

== What you will Learn

* How to build on an existing Mule flow in Mule Studio
* How to get data from an HTTP inbound endpoint and output it to a file using an outbound endpoint

=== Prerequisites

This example requires that you run through the earlier example link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.3/transforming-data-in-a-flow[Transforming Data in a Flow].

=== Building the Example

. We are going to continue editing the example and add a File component to the flow. Drag the File endpoint from the palette to the canvas after the Echo component.

. Double-click on the File endpoint to edit its properties.

. In the "General" tab, give your flow a name and choose a path and name for the file that will be outputted. In the example below,
+
[source, code, linenums]
----
#[function:datestamp]
----

is a Mule expression which automatically appends the current date & time to a file named myfile.

== Running the Example

. Right-click on the flow in the project tree and select Run As... -> Mule Application.

. Next, open up a browser and go to http://localhost:8081/echo. You should see the following in your browser:

. Now, go back to Mule Studio and check the logs - you will see that myfile#timestamp got created in the specified location with the output inside of it. Browse to the directory in your file explorer and open the file to see your output.

== What Just Happened?

* You sent an HTTP request via an inbound endpoint by going to http://localhost:8081/echo.
* You added a File endpoint to your flow which demonstrated how Mule can take the information via the HTTP request and output it in different places (in this case, a file).
