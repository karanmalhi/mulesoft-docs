= Notes on Mule 3.0 Schema Changes

The following changes have been made to schemas within Mule 3.0.  For details on the schemas themselves, consult the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/schema-documentation[schemadoc] added with Mule 3.0.

== Core Mule

* The `synchronous` attribute has been removed in favor of the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/endpoint-configuration-reference[exchange-pattern] attribute.
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/endpoint-configuration-reference[Dynamic endpoints] can be designated on most transports.
* Transformers, routers, filters, and other constructs that affect the processing of messages are now all Message Processors and can be used more flexibly inside a Mule configuration.
* In addition to services, message processing can be configured using link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/using-flows-for-service-orchestration[flows] and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/using-mule-configuration-patterns[configuration patterns].

== BPM

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/bpm-module-reference[BPM] now includes the element `jbpm-connector` to specify a jBpm connector.

== CXF

* The CXF schema is quite different now that CXF has been changed from a transport to a module. For details, see Upgrading CXF from Mule 2.

== E-mail

* The e-mail connectors (link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/imap-transport-reference[IMAP], link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/imap-transport-reference[IMAPS], link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/pop3-transport-reference[POP3], and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/pop3-transport-reference[POP3S]) support a new attribute `moveToFolder`, which specifies a folder to move e-mail messages to after they have been read.

== File

* The legacy filename parser, used for Mule 1 compatibility, has been removed. The expression filename parser is now the default.

== HTTP

* The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/http-transport-reference[HTTP transport] defines a new transformer element `body-to-parameter-map-transformer`, which transforms the body of an HTTP message into a map.
* HTTP outbound endpoints now have the boolean attribute `follow-redirects`, which applies to HTTP GETs only.

== JMS

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/jms-transport-reference[JMS] connectors have the new boolean attribute `embeddedMode`, which tells Mule to avoid using certain JMS features.

== Management

* In the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/jmx-management[Management module], the element `jmx-server` now takes the boolean attribute `createRmiRegistry`, which specifies whether to create an RMI registry if none exists.

== Quartz

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/quartz-transport-reference[Quartz] endpoints have a new boolean attribute `stateful`, which determines whether the current job is peristent.

== Servlet

* Inbound and global link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/servlet-transport-reference[Servlet] endpoints have a new attribute `path`, which specifies the path of the servlet to bind to.

== TCP

* A custom implementation for the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/tcp-transport-reference[TCP] protocol can now be specified as a reference to a Spring bean.

== VM

* The connector no longer takes the attribute `queueEvents`. Queuing behavior is now determined by the endpoint's exchange pattern.

== XML

* The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.5/xml-module-reference[XML] now includes JAXB and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/xquery-support[XQuery Support] transformers and extensions.
* The `xml-to-object-transformer` element can now be further configured to customize XStream behavior.
