[WARNING]
====
Running Studio on a Mac? +
 +
If you're using Mac OS X Mountain Lion, there are two extra considerations to be mindful of when running Anypoint Studio. +
 +
Java Runtime Environment +
 +
Check to confirm that Java runtime environment 7 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: java -version +
 +
The response should appear similar to the following: +
 +
[source]
----
java version "1.7.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_60-b19)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.60-b09, mixed mode)
----
If a Java runtime environment is not installed, the command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK  7.

*Application Execution*

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio outside the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. (Note: you must have Administrator privileges to adjust the security settings.)

. On your Mac, open *System Preferences*, then navigate to *Security & Privacy*.
. In the *General* tab, under "Allow applications downloaded from:" select the radio button for *Anywhere*.

[tab,title="Mule Enterprise Runtime with MMC (Trial Version)"]
....
. Before installing Mule Studio, be sure to install one of the compatible http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java Development Kits] on your host machine, refer to https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/35X/Hardware+and+Software+Requirements[Hardware and Software Requirements] for reference.
+

image:/https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/download/thumbnails/122750663/anypoint_Studio.png?version=1&modificationDate=1421449551018[image]

. Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path in which you installed the JDK.
. Visit http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-open-source-esb[mulesoft.com] to download *Mule ESB Enterprise with Anypoint Studio*.
. Navigate to the folder that contains your copy of *Mule Enterprise Standalone*, then unpack and uncompress the file.
. Open a system terminal and navigate to the freshly extracted folder, for example by running cd `mmc-distribution-mule-console-bundle-3.5.0`.
. From the terminal, run the appropriate startup command for your operating system.
+

.. Windows:
+

[source]
----
startup.bat
----
+

.. Linux or Mac:
+

[source]
----
./startup.sh
----

+
. Wait for Mule to start running, which may take a minute or two. MMC will automatically deploy and start running from an embedded Tomcat server. Once Mule and MMC are running, you should see a message similar to the following:
+

[source]
----
Mule running as PID=#####
Tomcat and MMC running as PID=#####
Finished starting Mule and MMC.
----

+
. The Mule startup messages displays the URL where Tomcat is serving the MMC application, for example `http://localhost:8585/mmc-3.5.0.` Use a Web browser to navigate to this URL.
. You will be greeted by the MMC welcome screen, shown below. Log in with username admin, password admin. +

[NOTE]
To stop Mule, run the shutdown.sh script (or shutdown.bat if on Windows) from the root folder of your installation.

[TIP]
For full details on the different options for running the startup, shutdown and status scripts, see https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/35X/Installing+the+Trial+Version+of+MMC[Installing the Trial Version of MMC].

[TIP]
The trial version is not suitable for running applications in production. To run applications in production, https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/35X/Installing+an+Enterprise+License[acquire an Enterprise license].
