*Anypoint Connectors(TM)* facilitate easy integration of your Mule applications with third-party APIs and standard integration protocols. Use connectors within your application's flows to send and receive data using a protocol or specific API. 

Anypoint Connectors are automatically bundled with Anypoint Studio, and there is a large library of additional connectors available for download in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector[Anypoint Exchange]. You can also create a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/publishing-and-consuming-apis-with-mule[REST or SOAP API connector], or create your own connectors using link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7[Anypoint Connector DevKit]. For more information on integration solutions, see the http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/cloud-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] product site.

You can "test drive" a connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/anypoint-exchange#installing-a-connector-from-anypoint-exchange[Installing a Connector from Anypoint Exchange].  

Import additional connectors into your Studio instance, or create applications using connectors outside of Studio by adding them as Maven dependencies or including connector libraries with your project.

For more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/connectors-user-guide[Connectors User Guide].

The following shows the relationship of connectors to other components in the Anypoint Platform:
