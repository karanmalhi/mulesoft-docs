== Which Version of Mule am I Using?

Already have Mule installed? You can follow these steps in *Anypoint Studio* and *Mule Standalone* to determine the version number of your Mule runtime.

This procedure assumes that Studio is launched and that you have opened a new or existing project. If you have not yet opened your first project in Studio, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*, and observe the default value in the *Server Runtime* field in the wizard.

To view the Studio version, right-click the project name in Package Explorer. The version appears next to the mule-project.xml file name. You can also double-click the mule-project.xml file name and view the version in the Server Runtime field:
