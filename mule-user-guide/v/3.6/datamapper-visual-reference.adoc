= Anypoint DataMapper Visual Reference
:keywords: datamapper

[NOTE]
DataMapper will continue to be fully supported in all current and future versions of Mule ESB 3.x, however it will be removed in Mule 4.0. We recommend that if you wish to take advantage of the new capabilities of link:https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/DataWeave[DataWeave] or if you start new projects, upgrade now. However, if you have no pressing need to take advantage of new functionality, we recommend you wait until Mule 4.0 is released.


This page contains annotated images of all of the major views used in Anypoint DataMapper. It is meant as a reference for the discussions in the rest of the DataMapper documentation, to help identify each control in the UI.

== DataMapper Configuration Overview

To use a DataMapper transformer in your application, you perform the following high-level tasks:

. Drag a DataMapper transformer from the Studio Palette to the canvas, and place it in the desired location in your flow.

. Click the DataMapper transformer in the flow. Studio will display the DataMapper properties editor, shown below.
+
image:overview.jpeg[overview]

. Define the input and output properties for your mapping (this step is required for actually creating the mapping). The required tasks are:

.. Define the *Source* of your input data.

.. Define the *Type* for your input data.

.. Define the *Target* for your output data.

.. Define the *Type* for your output data.

To define the type for your input data, click the edit icon
image:edit_icon.jpeg[edit_icon] or the drop-down menu to the right of the *Type* input field. DataMapper displays a mapping configuration view according to the input type you selected. The image below displays the configuration view for input type `CSV`.

image:a1.before_mapping-CSV.png[a1.before_mapping-CSV]

Using this window, you define the input and output mapping properties, including data types and fields (for details, see https://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Defining+DataMapper+Input+and+Output+Metadata[Defining DataMapper Input and Output Metadata]).

. After defining the mapping properties, click the *Create mapping* button at the bottom of the editor. The properties editor becomes the graphical mapping editor, shown below, in which you can define your data mapping proper.
+

. Define your mapping, adjusting or mapping fields as necessary.

== DataMapper Properties Editor Overview

The image below describes the different icons, indicators and tools in DataMapper's properties editor. For a description of each item, consult the numbered table below the image.

For details on creating your mapping, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/defining-datamapper-input-and-output-metadata[Defining DataMapper Input and Output Metadata].

image:1.before_mapping.png[1.before_mapping]

Notice the *Create mapping* button at the bottom of the image above. The button is grayed-out; it will be available only after you have defined the input and output parameters for your mapping.
