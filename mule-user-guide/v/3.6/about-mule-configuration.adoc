Following is an introduction to configuring Mule ESB via the Spring XML file. For details on this file, see link:/documentation/display/current/About+the+XML+Configuration+File[About the XML Configuration File].

== Overview of a Mule Configuration

A Mule ESB configuration file is a tree, as shown in the following illustration:

image:muleConfig.png[muleConfig]

Each of these elements provides access to configuration object within Mule:

* link:/documentation/display/current/Custom+Message+Processors[Custom Message Processors] - Observe a message, or modify either a message or the message flow. Examples include transformers and filters.

* link:/documentation/display/current/Using+Flows+for+Service+Orchestration[Flows] - Use message processors to define message flow between a source and a target.

* link:#AboutMuleConfiguration-Global[Mule Global Configuration] - Global settings, such as the default transaction time-out, that apply to the entire Mule configuration

* link:/documentation/display/current/Configuring+a+Transport[Connectors] - Non-default configuration of any transports used

* link:/documentation/display/current/Endpoint+Configuration+Reference[Endpoints] - Define the channel and address or path where messages are sent or received. You can define them globally and use them in multiple flows.

* link:/documentation/display/current/Using+Transformers[Transformers] - Convert data from one format to another. You can define them globally and use them in multiple flows.

* link:#[Filters] - Filter out the messages that don't match specific criteria. You can define them globally and use them in multiple flows.

Following is an example of a simple Mule configuration file:

Other, more advanced things you may configure at this level:

* link:/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Security[Security Manager] - Authenticates requests based on one or more security providers

* link:/documentation/display/current/Mule+Agents[Agents] - Agents are typically used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging or management

* link:/documentation/display/current/Mule+Server+Notifications[Notifications] - Allow you to be notified upon certain lifecycle events

* link:/documentation/display/current/Transaction+Management[Transaction Management] - Mule transactions are configured on inbound endpoints, where an endpoint can be configured to start a new transaction or join an existing one.

* link:/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties[Properties] - Property placeholders, message properties, and system properties.

== Global Configuration Settings

You can configure global configuration settings such as the default transaction timeout and default threading profile in the `<configuration>` element. For example:

[source]
----
<mule>
...
  <configuration defaultTransactionTimeout="31337">
    <default-threading-profile poolExhaustedAction="RUN"/>
...
  </configuration>
----

For a list of the available global configuration settings, see link:/documentation/display/current/Global+Settings+Configuration+Reference[Global Settings Configuration Reference].

== Accessing the Configuration Programmatically

All Mule configuration is accessible from a single object: org.mule.api.config.MuleConfiguration.

Configurations in a MuleConfiguration are set when a `MuleContext` is created. The object becomes immutable after it is started and can be accessed using the following:

[source, java]
----
// implement MuleContextAware to have the reference injected
MuleConfiguration configuration = context.getConfiguration();
----
