= Using Subversion with Studio
:keywords: anypoint studio, studio, mule esb, version control, versioning, subversion


http://subversion.apache.org/[Subversion] facilitates the tracking and versioning of changes developers make to a software project; this enables several people to work on the same project simultaneously without creating conflicts among the changes and additions they make.

Studio enables you to work with Subversion (SVN) in two ways: you can save your Studio project to an SVN repository, or you can import your existing projects from SVN into Studio. To move projects between Studio and SVN, you must first install Subversion's *Subeclipse plugin* in Studio.

== Installing the Subversion Plugin

. From Studio, click *Help*, then select *Install New Software...* +

 *Note*: Use "1.8.x" as shown (the .x is not a placeholder): +
 +
`Subclipse Update Site – http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.8.x ` +

== Committing a Project

You can save a Studio project to an SVN repository so that multiple developers can save changes to the project in a single, shared location. When you have completed your individual work on a Studio project, you can check the project into the SVN repository, thus avoiding version conflicts with other users.

[WARNING]
This procedure assumes that you have already created ---and have read-write access to — a shared Subversion repository.

. In *Package Explorer*, right click your project name, navigate to *Team*, then select **Share Project...**. +
 +

. In the *Share Project* wizard, specify the location of your SVN project in the *URI* field, then click *Next*. +
 +

[NOTE]
If you have already configured an SVN repository in Studio, you can select *Use existing repository location* to commit your project to the existing repository. +
 +

. In the next wizard panel, specify the name of your project's folder within the SVN repository. +
 +

. Click *Next*, then edit the commit comments, if you wish, to describe the changes you have made to the project. +
 +

. Click *Finish*.
. Studio displays a panel that gives you the option to automatically open *Synchronize View*, which ensures that your local workspace does not conflict with your team's repository. Click *Yes* to open the view and begin synchronizing your workspaces; click *No* to simply return to your local workspace in Studio.

== Checking Out a Project

You may wish to check out a Subversion project and import it into Studio in order to leverage Studio's graphical user interface. To do so, you must first install an SVN plugin, then access your SVN project from Studio.

[WARNING]
This procedure assumes that you have already created ---and have read-write access to — a shared Subversion repository, and that you have saved to that repository the project you wish to access in Studio.

. Starting from Studio's application menu, click *Window*, navigate to *Open Perspective,* then select *Other...* +
 +

. In the pop-up panel, select *SVN Repository Exploring*, then click *OK*. +

+
[TIP]
To switch back to the *Mule* perspective, click the Mule icon next to *SVN Repository Exploring*. You can switch back and forth between perspectives as needed.
+

. After Studio opens the new perspective, *SVN Repository Exploring*, right-click within the *SVN Repositories* explorer tab, select *New*, then **Repository Location...**. +
 +
image:/documentation/download/attachments/122752327/repo_location2.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339699335193[image]

. In the *Url* field, enter the location of your SVN repository and click *Finish*. +
 +
image:/documentation/download/attachments/122752327/add_SVN_cropped.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339620577389[image]

. In the SVN Repository Exploring tab, right click your project name and select *Checkout*. Within context of Subversion, you are checking out the project from your SVN repository. +
 +
image:/documentation/download/attachments/122752327/checkout_2.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339698657248[image]

. Click the *Mule* perspective to work on the project in Studio. +
 +
image:/documentation/download/attachments/122752327/mule_pers.png?version=1&modificationDate=1339622141866[image]

. After you have completed your changes to your Studio project, you must commit your changes to the SVN repository. In the Mule perspective, click *File*, then *Save*.
. In *Package Explorer*, right click your project name, navigate to *Team*, then select **Commit...**. +
 +

. In the *Commit message* field of the *Commit Changes* panel, enter notes to describe what you have added or changed in the Studio project.
. Click the check box next to all items listed in the *Files* pane, then click *Commit* to save the changes to the SVN repository.
