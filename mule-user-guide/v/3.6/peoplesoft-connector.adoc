== Introduction

Anypoint Connector for PeopleSoft provides real-time connectivity to query and update all PeopleSoft modules, using a common integration interface known as the Component Interface.

The connector has been developed for the PeopleSoft v9.2 and PeopleTools v8.53.02 or higher, which makes it compatible only with a Mule ESB or CloudHub instance running on Java v1.7. 

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Download JRE 1.7].

*Release Notes:* link:/release-notes/peoplesoft-connector-release-notes[PeopleSoft Connector Release Notes].

== Prerequisites

Because of how closely the connector is coupled with PeopleSoft, this document assumes you have :

* A working knowledge of PeopleSoft.
* Read the relevant documentation on Component Interfaces and Integration Scenarios for your PeopleTools version.

[NOTE]
The definition and detailed explanation of the PeopleSoft terms and concepts used here are freely available in the PeopleBooks documentation set of your PeopleSoft installation.

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule, link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors], and link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/anypoint-connector-tutorial[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/elements-in-a-mule-flow[Mule flows] andlink:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.6/global-elements[Mule Global Elements].

The document also assumes that you are familiar with http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven].

To use the PeopleSoft connector, you must have the following:

* *Anypoint Studio*. If you don't use Anypoint Studio for development, follow the instructions to http://mulesoft.github.io/salesforce-connector/guide/install[install the PeopleSoft Maven dependencies] into your pom.xml file .

* **Apache Maven 3.x**: If you want to create Mule application using Maven.

* *Java 7*: PeopleSoft connector does not work unless you are using JRE 1.7. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Download JRE 1.7].

* *Component Interface*: At least one Component Interface must be created and exposed within the PeopleSoft instance using the Application Designer.

* **PeopleSoft Java Object Adapter JAR File (psjoa.jar)**: The psjoa.jar library is compiled and provided by a PeopleSoft administrator, and is unique to each installation of PeopleSoft.

== PeopleSoft Component Interfaces

PeopleSoft Component Interfaces (CI) are a “one-way”, real-time interface to your PeopleSoft database instance. A component in PeopleSoft is a logical grouping of PeopleSoft pages representing a complete business transaction, such as Employee Onboarding. Component Interfaces expose the underlying APIs used by PeopleSoft Components and, therefore, ensure that validations, defaults, and business logic are preserved from the original definition of those components.

The Component Interfaces allow you to query PeopleSoft for specific records, update data, and create new instances of the records.

==== Component Interface Attributes and Architecture

A component interface has the following four main attributes:

image:CI+archtecture.jpeg[CI+archtecture]

*  *Component Interface Name*: Each component interface requires a unique name. The programs calling a component use the name of the component interface to access properties and methods. 
*  **Keys (Get keys, Create keys, and Find keys)**: Keys are special properties containing values that retrieve an instance (get keys) or a list of instances (find keys) of the component interface. You can add, remove, or change keys in PeopleSoft Application Designer. Keys are created automatically when you create a component interface. +
** *Get keys:* Map to fields marked as search keys in the Components Search record.
** *Create keys:* Generated in CI when the Use tab on the Component Properties dialog allows the Add action.
** *Find keys:* Map to fields marked as both Alternate Search keys and Search Key in the Component Search Record.
*  *Properties and Collections (Fields and Records):* Properties provide access to both component data and component interface settings. A property can correspond to a field or a scroll (collection). A component interface collection is a special type of property that corresponds to a scroll and contains fields and subordinate scrolls as defined in its underlying component. There are two types of properties:   +
** *Standard properties* are assigned automatically when a component interface is created. 
** *User-defined properties* map to record fields on the PeopleSoft component and are displayed in the PeopleSoft Application Designer.
*  *Methods:* A method is a function that performs a specific task on a component interface at run time. There are two main types of methods: standard and user-defined**.**  +
**  *Standard methods* are those that are available for all component interfaces. The following are the standard methods that the connector supports:
+
[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Method |Description
|*Create* |Add a new instance of the Component Interface to the PeopleSoft database. This is similar to clicking Add and entering the relevant keys through the PeopleSoft Web UI.
|*Cancel* |Cancel an instance of the Component Interface. This is equivalent of the Cancel operation in the Web UI when working on a particular component.
|*Find* |Search for any instances of the component that match the provided Search Keys. This returns a list of possible matches.
|*Get* |Retrieve instances that match the specific keys you provide. This returns a single record or none at all.
|*Save* a|
Save changes made to the component, new, or existing.

[WARNING]
The Save operation tries to update an existing record before creating a new one. For new records, the connector automatically populates the keys with default values provided by the PeopleSoft instance, thereby reducing the need for the user to provide the default key/values pairs.

|===
+
** *User-defined methods* are created in PeopleSoft Application Designer to provide added functionality to the component interface.

== Using the Connector

PeopleSoft connector is an operation-based connector, which means that when you add the connector to your flow, you need to configure a specific operation (Invoke operation) for the connector to perform. The XML element for the Invoke operation is **peoplesoft:invoke-operation**. After you call the Invoke operation, you can use the Type field to select a method that you want to execute on a particular Component Interface. PeopleSoft connector allows you to perform five standard operations (Create, Find, Get, Save, Cancel) on each Component Interface, along with any CI-specific custom operations.

=== Use Cases

Listed below are the most common use cases for the PeopleSoft connector: +

. Polling records from PeopleSoft and writing them to a .CSV file.
. Polling records from a .CSV file and writing them to PeopleSoft.

=== Adding to a Flow

. Create a new Mule project in Anypoint Studio. If you prefer, you can also start a Maven-based project.
. Add a suitable Mule Inbound endpoint, such as the HTTP listener or File endpoint, to begin the flow.
. Search for and drag the PeopleSoft connector onto the canvas, then select it to open the properties editor.
. Configure the PeopleSoft connector's parameters:
