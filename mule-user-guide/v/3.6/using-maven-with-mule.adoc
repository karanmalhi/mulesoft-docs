= Using Maven with Mule
:keywords: studio, maven, esb, version control, dependencies, libraries

http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] is a project management utility that you can use to develop projects in Mule. Mule provides built-in Maven functionality, including the features listed below.

*In Anypoint Studio:*

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/building-a-mule-application-with-maven-in-studio[Building a Mule application with Maven in Studio]
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/enabling-maven-support-for-a-studio-project[Enabling Maven support for an existing Studio project]
* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/importing-a-maven-project-into-studio[Importing a Maven project into Studio]

*In Mule* *ESB:*

Maven-Mule ESB functionality is provided by two Mule plugins for Maven.

* link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/maven-tools-for-mule-esb[Maven tools for Mule ESB] is a plugin that provides archetypes for building regular Mule applications, allowing you to develop Mule applications from within Maven
* The link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/mule-esb-plugin-for-maven[muleesb-maven-plugin] allows you to control Mule ESB instances from within a Maven environment

This page provides an overview of the benefits and options for working with Maven to manage your Mule projects.

== Assumptions

This document assumes that you are familiar with Maven, managing pom.xml files, and working with Maven plugins. If you are just getting started with Maven, we suggest you follow http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/[Maven's Getting Started tutorial].

== Benefits

Though highly recommended, a project manager like Maven is not strictly necessary to develop applications in Mule. You can build, manage, and deploy Mule applications using Mule Studio without enabling Maven support, or you can build Mule applications outside of Studio without Maven by manually creating your folder structure and importing the required libraries into your packaged applications. However, Maven can facilitate the management of your Mule applications both inside and outside of Mule Studio, providing these benefits:

* When you create a new Mule project using MuleSoft's mule-project-archetype or create a Maven-enabled project in Studio, you can be confident that you are working with the correct Mule project folder structure and basic set of standard dependencies.
* If you are working with Maven in Studio, Studio automatically manages your POM file every time you add new elements to your flow that require additional dependencies.
* The Maven POM file makes sharing projects easier and more lightweight, because the POM references the dependencies so that you don't have to manually find and include every dependency within the project itself.
* If you are working in a team, each team member might have different Studio configurations or be referencing different dependency versions. Using Maven to manage the builds ensures that the resulting final build is sanitized and standardized.
* Using Maven, you can program automatic builds using external frameworks such as bamboo for continuous integration. 

== Options for Using Maven with Mule

Depending on where you are with your project and what your goals are, you can:

* **Build and run a new Maven project in Mule Studio.** If you're starting from scratch and you want to use Maven to build your project, begin by creating a new Maven-based project in Studio. You can then run the project with Maven from the command line, or run it directly from Studio. See link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/building-a-mule-application-with-maven-in-studio[Building a Mule Application with Maven in Studio] for a step-by-step guide demonstrating how to create, manage, and run a Mule project with Maven.

* *Create and run a new Maven in Mule ESB.* If you want to use Maven to create your project for Mule ESB (outside Studio), use *Maven Tools for Mule ESB*. This is a Mule plugin that makes it extremely easy to create a Mule application by running Maven with a few simlpe parameters. You need to add dependencies for any link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] that you want to use in your project and, if you are an Enterprise customer, configure your settings.xml file to point to the MuleSoft Enterprise repository. To enable access, click *Help* > *Install New Software* and in *Work with*, click *Anypoint Addons Update Site* > *Maven Tools for Mule*. Click *Next* and follow the install prompts: +

* **Import an existing Maven project into Studio.** If you already have a Maven project you want to work on further with Studio, use the built-in functionality in Studio to import the pom.xml file using the `studio:studio` goal. Access link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/importing-a-maven-project-into-studio[Importing a Maven Project into Studio] for details. +

* **Mavenize an existing Studio project.** If you have built a project in Studio and want to convert it to a Maven project, you can use the built-in support in Studio to "Mavenize" the project. Access link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/enabling-maven-support-for-a-studio-project[Enabling Maven Support for a Studio Project] for details.

== Tips

* **Use Studio:** Studio's built-in Maven support minimizes the chance that you would have to manually update your POM file with new dependencies as you add to, or modify your applications.   +

* **Update your POM file and settings.xml if necessary:** If you create Maven projects from the command line using archetypes, you need to manage your POM file manually, and in some cases, adjust your `settings.xml` file to point to the MuleSoft Enterprise repository and supply credentials. In some cases, even if you manage your project with Studio, you may need to make manual adjustments to your POM as well. See the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/configuring-maven-to-work-with-mule-esb[configuration instructions] for more information. +

* *SNAPSHOT version:* Use SNAPSHOT to identify versions of your project as you work toward producing a stable product you intend to release. For example, you can build a 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT version of your project, test functionality, make changes etc. until you are ready to release it as version 1.0.0. Then you can build upon using a new version, 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.
