= Hardware and Software Requirements
:keywords: esb, mule, requirements, os, jdk, installation

This page lists the hardware, operating systems, JREs, and other requirements to run Mule ESB, the API Gateway, Mule Management Console, and Anypoint Studio.

== Mule ESB

=== *Hardware Requirements**
* 2GHz, dual-core CPU, or 2 virtual CPUs in virtualized environments
* 2GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage

=== *Software Requirements*

==== *Java Runtime Environments*

For ESB Runtime 3.6.0 or later: +

* Oracle Java 1.7.0_60 or later
* IBM version 1.7
* *Java 6 and Java 8 are not supported*

==== *Operating Systems*

**Mule runs on any operating system supported by the above JREs.** To ensure this, every Mule release is validated against specific versions of the most widely used operating systems. 

The operating systems MuleSoft used to validate the current release are:

* Windows (32- and 64-bit) 2003, 2008, Windows 7, Windows 2012
* Mac OS 10.7, 10.8
* Linux RHEL (64-bit) 5.3, 6.1
* Ubuntu Server 12.04 (64-bit)**
* Solaris OS 10
* HP-UX 11i V3
* AIX V7.1

Because the only mandatory requirement for Mule ESB is Java, Mule ESB should also run on any later versions of the tested operating systems in the above list, as well as any other operating systems supported by the JREs.

*** This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM Mule needs). 

** If you use SSL, MuleSoft recommends installing Ubuntu Server 12.14 (64-bit) instead of 12.04.

== API Gateway

=== *Hardware Requirements**

* 2GHz, dual-core CPU, or 2 virtual CPUs in virtualized environments
* 2GB of RAM
* 4GB of storage

=== *Software Requirements*

==== *Java Runtime Environments*

* Oracle Java 1.7

==== *Operating Systems*

**The API Gateway runs on any operating system supported by the above JRE.** To ensure this, every API Gateway release is validated against specific versions of the most widely used operating systems. 

The operating systems MuleSoft used to validate the current release are:

* Windows (32- and 64-bit) 2003, 2008, Windows 7, Windows 2012
* Mac OS 10.7, 10.8
* Linux RHEL (64-bit) 5.3, 6.1
* Ubuntu Server 12.04 (64-bit)**
* Solaris OS 10
* HP-UX 11i V3
* AIX V7.1

Because the only mandatory requirement for the API Gateway is Java, the API Gateway should also run on any later versions of the tested operating systems in the above list, as well as any other operating systems supported by the JRE.

*** This hardware requirements list is a recommendation and a starting point. Different applications have different requirements for the amount of latency (and thus raw CPU power) or the size and number of simultaneous messages that applications need to process (which in turn determines the amount of RAM the API Gateway needs).

** If you use SSL, MuleSoft recommends installing Ubuntu Server 12.14 (64-bit) instead of 12.04.

== Mule Management Console

=== *Hardware Requirements**

* 2GHz CPU
* 4 GB of RAM
* 10 GB of storage

=== *Software Requirements*

==== *Java Runtime Environments*

* Oracle Java 1.7

==== *Web Application Servers*

* JBoss 6 or 6.1
* Tomcat 6.x or 7.x
* Tcat 6.x or 7.x
* WebSphere Application Server 7.0 and 8.0

==== *Operating Systems*

Mule Management Console will run on any operating system supported by one of the above web application servers.

==== *Browsers*

* Firefox (latest version)
* Chrome (latest version)
* Safari (latest version)
* Internet Explorer 9 or later

*** We strongly recommend running Mule Management Console on a separate server from the hardware that runs Mule ESB.

* link:/documentation/display/current/Persisting+MMC+Data+to+MS+SQL+Server[MS SQL Server]
|===

Mule Management Console should be run as a web application deployed on a web container such as JBoss or Tomcat, and NOT as a Mule application. We recommend configuring the web application server's memory areas with the following minimum sizes:

*  Heap: 2GB (3GB recommended) 
*  Permanent Generation: 512MB


== Anypoint Studio

=== *Hardware Requirements*

* 3GB of RAM
* 2GHz CPU
* 4GB free hard drive space

=== *Software Requirements*

==== *Java Runtime Environments*

* Oracle Java 1.7

==== *Operating Systems*

* Windows (32- and 64-bit) Windows 7, Windows 8
* Mac OS (32- or 64-bit) 
* Linux (32- or 64-bit) 

== Anypoint Studio as Eclipse Plug-in

=== *Hardware Requirements*

* 3GB of RAM
* 2GHz CPU
* 4GB free hard drive space

=== *Software Requirements*

==== *Eclipse*

* Eclipse 3.8 for Java Developers or Java EE Developers
* Spring Tool Suite (STS) versions that run on top of Eclipse 3.8

==== *Java Runtime Environments*

* Oracle Java 1.7

*Operating Systems*

* Windows (32- or 64-bit) Windows 7, Windows 8
* Mac OS (32- or 64-bit) 
* Linux (32- or 64-bit)
