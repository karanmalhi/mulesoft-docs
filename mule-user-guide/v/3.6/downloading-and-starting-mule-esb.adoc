[WARNING]
====
*Running Studio on a Mac?*

If you're using Mac OS, there are two extra considerations when running Anypoint Studio.

*Java Runtime Environment*

Check to confirm that the Java runtime environment 7 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: ` java -version`

The response should appear similar to the following:

[source]
----
java version "1.7.0_55"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_55-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.55-b03, mixed mode)
----

If a Java runtime environment is _not_ installed, the command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK 7.

*Application Execution*

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. (Note: you must have Administrator privileges to adjust the security settings.)

. On your Mac, open *System Preferences*, then navigate to **Security & Privacy**.

. In the *General* tab, under "Allow applications downloaded from:", select the radio button for *Anywhere*.

. Install http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java SE Development Kit 7].

. Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path in which you installed the JDK.

. Visit http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-open-source-esb[mulesoft.com] to download *Mule ESB Enterprise with Management Tools.*

. Navigate to the folder that contains your copy of *Mule Enterprise Standalone,* then unpack and uncompress the file.

. Open a system terminal and navigate to the freshly extracted folder, for example by running `cd mmc-distribution-mule-console-bundle-3.6.0`.

. From the terminal, run the appropriate startup command for your operating system.

.. Windows:
+
[source]
----
startup.bat
----

.. Linux or Mac:
+
[source]
----
./startup.sh
----

. Wait for Mule to start running, which may take a minute or two. MMC automatically deploys and starts running from an embedded Tomcat server. After Mule and MMC are running, this message appears:
+
[source]
----
Mule running as PID=#####
Tomcat and MMC running as PID=#####
Finished starting Mule and MMC.
----

. The Mule startup messages displays the URL where Tomcat is serving the MMC application, for example `http://localhost:8585/mmc-3.6.0`. Use a Web browser to navigate to this URL.

. You are greeted by the MMC welcome screen, shown below. Log in with username `admin`, password `admin`.

[NOTE]
====
To stop Mule, run the `shutdown.sh` script (or `shutdown.bat` if on Windows) from the root folder of your installation.
====
+
[TIP]
====
For full details on the different options for running the startup, shutdown and status scripts, see link:/documentation/display/current/Installing+the+Trial+Version+of+MMC[Installing the Trial Version of MMC].
====
+
[TIP]
====
The trial version is not suitable for running applications in production. To run applications in production, link:/documentation/display/current/Installing+an+Enterprise+License[acquire an Enterprise license].
