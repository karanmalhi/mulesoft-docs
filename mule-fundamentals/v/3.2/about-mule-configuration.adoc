Following is an introduction to configuring Mule ESB via the Spring XML file. For details on this file, see #[MULE3USER:About the XML Configuration File]#.

== Overview of a Mule Configuration

A Mule ESB configuration file is a tree, as shown in the following illustration:

image:muleConfig.png[muleConfig]

Each of these elements provides access to configuration object within Mule:

* #[MULE3USER:Custom Message processors]# - Observe a message, or modify either a message or the message flow. Examples include transformers and filters.

* #[Flows]# - Use message processors to define message flow between a source and a target.

* http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation-3.2/display/32X/about+mule+configuration#AboutMuleConfiguration-Global[MULE3CONCEPTS:Mule Global Configuration] - Global settings, such as the default transaction time-out, that apply to the entire Mule configuration

* #[Connectors]# - Non-default configuration of any transports used

* #[Endpoints]# - Define the channel and address or path where messages are sent or received. You can define them globally and use them in multiple flows.

* #[Transformers]# - Convert data from one format to another. You can define them globally and use them in multiple flows.

* #[Filters]# - Filter out the messages that don't match specific criteria. You can define them globally and use them in multiple flows.

* #[MULE3USER:Models]# - One or more models that logically group together your services.

* #[Services]# - One or more services that wrap your components (business logic) and configure routers, endpoints, transformers, and filters specifically for that service

Following is an example of a simple Mule configuration file:

<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:vm="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/vm"

    <vm:endpoint name="CustomerRequests" path="customer.requests"/>
    <vm:endpoint name="CustomerResponses" path="customer.responses"/>

    <custom-transformer name="ThisToThat" class="com.acme.transformer.ThisToThat"/>

    <flow name="myBasicFlow">
        <inbound-endpoint ref="CustomerRequests"/>
        <component class="com.acme.service.BasicService"/>
        <outbound-endpoint ref="CustomerResponses" transformer-refs="ThisToThat"/>
    </flow>
</mule>

Other, more advanced things you may configure at this level:

* #[Security Manager]# - Authenticates requests based on one or more security providers
* #[Agents]# - Agents are typically used for cross-cutting concerns such as logging or management
* #[Notifications]# - Allow you to be notified upon certain lifecycle events
* #[Transaction Management]# - Mule transactions are configured on inbound endpoints, where an endpoint can be configured to start a new transaction or join an existing one.
* #[Properties]# - Property placeholders, message properties, and system properties.

== Global Configuration Settings

You can configure global configuration settings such as the default transaction timeout and default threading profile in the <configuration> element. For example:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<mule>
...
  <configuration defaultTransactionTimeout="31337">
    <default-threading-profile poolExhaustedAction="RUN"/>
...
  </configuration>
----

For a list of the available global configuration settings, see #[MULE3USER:Global Settings Configuration Reference]#.

== Accessing the Configuration Programmatically

All Mule configuration is accessible from a single object: org.mule.api.config.MuleConfiguration . Configurations in a MuleConfiguration are set when a MuleContext is created. The object becomes immutable after it is started and can be accessed using the following:

[source, code, linenums]
----
// implement MuleContextAware to have the reference injected
MuleConfiguration configuration = context.getConfiguration();
