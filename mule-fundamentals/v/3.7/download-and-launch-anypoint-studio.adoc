== Running Studio on a Mac

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Anypoint Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. If you have Administrator privileges, you can adjust the security settings under *System Preferences* > **Security & Privacy**. However, you can also right-click on the application to bypass the security warning and proceed to open the app.
