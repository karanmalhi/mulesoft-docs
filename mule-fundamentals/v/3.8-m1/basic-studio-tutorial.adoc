= Basic Studio Tutorial
:keywords: studio, tutorial, request, response, http, listener, config

This exercise helps you understand Anypoint Studio and get comfortable building applications.

This tutorial walks you through how to use Anypoint Studio to build a simple HTTP request-response application. After creating and running the example locally, you are able to apply what you have learned to create link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/content-based-routing-tutorial[more complex applications].

== Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/download-and-launch-anypoint-studio[downloaded and installed Anypoint Studio]. If you do not have any previous experience with Eclipse or an Eclipse-based IDE, you can review the brief introduction to the link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[Anypoint Studio interface].

== Goals

This tutorial consists of these parts:

[width="100%",cols=",",options="header"]
|===
|# |Task |Section
|1 |Launch Anypoint Studio |<<Launching Studio>>
|2 |Create a simple application that displays a message in a browser |<<Constructing an Application>>
|3 |Learn about logging to display information in a log file |<<Adding Logging>>
|4 |Learn about flows in your application |<<Working With Flows>>
|5 |Add more features to your application |<<Extending Your Application>>
|===

== Launching Studio

If you have already launched Studio as part of the installation process, and it is now running, skip the rest of this section and proceed directly to <<Creating a New Project>>.

. Navigate to the directory on your local drive in which you installed Studio.
. Double-click the executable file to launch Studio.
** `AnypointStudio.exe` in Windows
** `AnypointStudio.app` in Mac OS
** `AnypointStudio` in Linux
. When Studio displays the *Workspace Launcher* dialog, click *OK* to accept the default workspace.
+
image:workspacelauncher.png[workspacelauncher]
+
. If this is the first time you have launched Studio, you see a Welcome screen. Click *Create a Project* to dismiss the screen and jump straight to the New Mule Project wizard.
+
image:WelcomeScreen.png[WelcomeScreen]

=== Creating a New Project

. If the New Mule Project screen is not open, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*.
. Studio opens the *New Mule Project* wizard. Fill in the *Name* field with the value `Basic Tutorial`.
+
image:basic-studio-new-mule-project.png[basic-studio-new-mule-project]
+
. Click *Finish* to create the project.

The main sections of the UI are the following:

image:blank+canvas.png[blank+canvas]

The blue area in the center is the canvas where you build a visual representation of your Mule program by dragging building blocks from the palette outlined in green to the canvas. We explain this in greater detail in the next section.

If necessary, see this link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-studio-essentials[quick overview] on how to use the visual editor to drag and drop building blocks from the palette onto the canvas.

At the bottom of the canvas are 3 tabs that let you alternate between visual and XML editing.

image:basic-t-canvas-tabs.png[basic-t-canvas-tabs]

These tabs are:

* *Message Flow* - The visual editor in the canvas.
* *Global Elements* - Lets you set properties for the building blocks.
* *Configuration XML* - A text editor that lets you view and change the XML file behind the visual representation.

=== More on the XML File

When you create a Mule Project, Anypoint Studio creates an XML file for you. Because you named the project Basic Tutorial, Studio creates the `basic_tutorial.xml` for you, which appears in
the *Package Explorer*, which is outlined in orange. This XML file appears inside the `src/main/app` folder:

image:packages.png[packages]

The `.xml` file stores flow information for the visual editor. When your new project opens for the first time, Anypoint Studio automatically opens the `.xml file` and presents you with a blank canvas.

The *mule-project.xml* file is the Mule project descriptor file. Open this file to change the project runtime, set or edit environment variables, or edit the project description. After you finish creating your project, you can commit this file, along with your <project_name>.xml file to your source control systems to avoid errors when sharing your project.

== Constructing an Application

In this section of the tutorial, we build an application that just displays a message you set in your browser.

This section uses these building blocks:

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/http-connector[HTTP Connector]* |Allows your Mule application to connect to Web resources through the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. Find this in the Connectors section of the palette.  
|*link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/set-payload-transformer-reference[Set Payload Transformer]* |Modifies your payload into a "Hello, World" message. Find this in the Transformers section of the palette.
|===

[NOTE]
====
*Tip: Use Studio Search*

image:basic-studio-search.png[basic-studio-search.png]

*Note*: Building blocks in each category of the palette are organized alphabetically. To avoid scrolling, use the search tool in the upper right corner of the palette to find the building blocks that you want more quickly. You can also use this area to view more information about the building block in link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-exchange[Anypoint Exchange].
====

. Search for "http" and drag the *HTTP Connector* to the canvas followed by *Set Payload*:
+
image:basic-t-starting-flow.png[basic-t-starting-flow]
+
. Click each block to set its properties:
+
.. For the HTTP connector, click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*:
+
image:basic-t-http-cfg.png[basic-t-http-cfg]
+
. When the menu appears, click *OK* to accept the default settings. This sets the host to `0.0.0.0` and the port to `8081`. When you test the application, you can view its information in a browser at `0.0.0.0:8081`:
+
image:basic-t-http-props.png[basic-t-http-props]
+
. For the Set Payload, in the *Value* field, erase the `#[]` value and add a statement such as `Hello MuleSoft`:
+
image:basic-t-set-payload.png[set payload]
+
With just a few clicks, you have created (also known as modeled) an  application on the Studio canvas.

=== Verifying That Your Application Works

Anypoint Studio makes it easy to test applications:

. Click the top project line name in *Package Explorer* and click *Run* > *Run As* > *Mule Application*:
+
image:basic-t-run-as-mule-app.png[basic-t-run-as-mule-app]
+
The console lists output and should end with statements similar to:
+
image:basic-t-mule-is-up-and-kicking.png[basic-t-mule-is-up-and-kicking]
+
. Open a browser and type the address as 0.0.0.0:8081. The results are:
+
image:basic-t-browser-results.png[basic-t-browser-results]

Now you know your application works. Let's add more capabilities.

== Adding Logging

Logging is very useful for applications in that you can store messages from your application for errors, information, warnings, tracing, and debugging. Logging is configured with the log4j2.xml file which is in your project's `src/main/resources` path. You can view this path in the *Package Explorer*. You don't need to change anything in this file, but you can view it for more information on how logging works.

To add the Logger component, type "log" in the search and drag the Logger to your canvas:

image:basic-t-logging.png[basic-t-logging]

*Where does the logging output appear?*

The log4j2.xml file provides this definition:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<Appenders>
  <RollingFile name="file" fileName="${sys:mule.home}${sys:file.separator}logs${sys:file.separator}basic_tutorial.log"
           filePattern="${sys:mule.home}${sys:file.separator}logs${sys:file.separator}basic_tutorial-%i.log">
    <PatternLayout pattern="%d [%t] %-5p %c - %m%n" />
    <SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="10 MB" />
    <DefaultRolloverStrategy max="10"/>
  </RollingFile>
</Appenders>
----

This code contains definitions that Studio plugs in depending on where you locate your Studio workspace and your computer's operating system. The `mule.home` value is the path to where your workspace resides. The `file.separator` value is a backslash (\) in Windows or a forward slash in Mac and Linux. The actual log file name is your project's name with the `.log` file type. The log file appears in your Studio workspace in the `.mule` directory.

For example on a Mac, the path is:

[source,code]
----
/Users/me/AnypointStudio/workspace/.mule/logs/basic_tutorial.log
----

The first few entries are:

[source,code,linenums]
----

== Working With Flows

Nearly all Mule elements provide configuration options, which you can set in one of two ways:

* Via the building block *Properties* tabs in Studio's visual editor
* Via XML code in Studio's *XML* editor

The following instructions introduce you to configuring in both editors.

. Click *Configuration XML* at the bottom of the canvas to switch to the XML editor view.
+
image:canvas_tabs_xml.png[canvas_tabs_xml]
+
Notice that the flow is represented as a series of XML tags, with a `flow` element as the parent and three child elements, one for each of the ones you dragged into your canvas in the Visual Editor.
+
The `doc:name` attribute on each element corresponds to the display name that appears underneath the building block icon on the Message Flow canvas. Note that the `http:listener` element has its `path` property set to `*` as you configured in the properties editor, this element also has its property `config-ref` pointing to the Configuration Element that you created.
+
The Configuration Element sits above the flow you built, outside it, as it could potentially be referenced by other HTTP connectors on other flows. Observe that the configurations you set in the Configuration Element and those in the XML view of this element are the same:
+
If  you make any changes in the XML configuration view, for example if you change the value of the *port* attribute on the `http-listener-config`, then this change is reflected if you switch back to the visual editor and open the HTTP Connector's properties editor. Studio's two-way editor automatically updates the configuration as you switch back and forth.
. Click *Message Flow* to switch back to the visual editor.
+
image:canvas_tabs_flow.png[canvas_tabs_flow]  
+
. Click the *Logger* building block to switch the Properties Editor to the Logger component.
. In the *Message* field, enter: `Current path is #[message.inboundProperties.'http.request.path']`. Notice how a menu with suggestions pops open as soon as you type `#`, and narrows down its suggestions as you keep typing.
+
image:logger+for+path.png[logger+for+path]
+
The String `#[message.inboundProperties.'http.request.path']` is a simple link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule expression] which evaluates to the requested property of the message as it passes this point in the flow. Including this message here instructs Mule to log this information in the application log files, which can be useful in more complex use cases, when you need to track the payload at different points in your flow.
. Click the *Set Payload* building block to switch the Properties Editor to the Set Payload transformer.
+
image:set+payload1.png[set+payload1] +
+
Previously, you set this field to a simple literal by simply entering a string, this instructs Mule to set that string as your new payload. This field also supports link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule expressions], which take the form of a string enclosed with `#[]`. If you enter a Mule expression here, Mule evaluates it at runtime and returns or uses the results for further processing.
. In the *Value* field, enter the following dynamic expression: +
+
`#['Hello, ' + message.inboundProperties.'http.request.path' + '. Today is ' + server.dateTime.format('dd/MM/yy') + '.' ]`
+
image:set+payload2.png[set+payload2]
+
[NOTE]
Note that *`message.inboundProperties.'http.request.path'`* and *`server.dateTime.format('dd/MM/yy')`* are both Mule expressions. Because you are entering them within a larger Mule expression, the `#[]` syntax is not required around these individual expressions. Anything that you enter inside of the `#[]` syntax which is _not_ a Mule expression must be enclosed with quotes so that Mule reads it as a string.
. Save your application by clicking *File* > *Save*.

Your complete application XML, once configured, should look like the following:

[source,xml, linenums]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    </flow>
</mule>

== Extending Your Application

Now that you know your way around Anypoint Studio, try applying your knowledge to an extra task. Revise your application so that, in addition to returning the transformed payload as an HTTP response in your browser as it does now, Mule also:

. Logs the unique message ID that Mule automatically assigns to each message that passes through a flow
. Writes the message payload that you see in your browser to a new .txt file on your local drive 
. Names each .txt file using the message ID.

To achieve this, add another message processor to your flow to direct Mule to write your payload to a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/file-connector[file]. You also need to use another Mule expression that you haven't seen before in order to log and use the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-expression-language-reference[unique message ID]. Use the hints below if you need help.

image:icon-question-blue-big.png[icon-question-blue-big, width="50"] *Hints*

*How do I log the message ID?*

The Mule expression that resolves to the unique message ID of the current message is `#[message.id]`.

*How do I write to a file?*

Try adding a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/file-connector[File Connector] after the Set Payload transformer in your flow. 

*How do I name a text file using the message ID?*

Fill in the *File Name/Pattern* field in the File Endpoint to tell Mule how to name the file and what file type to use. Note that you can use the same Mule expression here that you used to log the message ID.

image:icon-checkmark-blue-big.png[icon-checkmark-blue-big, width="50"] *Answer*

View the answer, including explanation of steps and complete code.

There is more than one way to achieve the goals outlined above, but the following describes the quickest way.

. Click your existing *Logger* component to open its properties tab. 
. Revise the *Message* field to read:
+
[source,code]
----
Current path is #[message.inboundProperties.'http.request.path']
----
+
. Drag and drop a *File Endpoint* onto your canvas, immediately after the Set Payload transformer.
+
image:add+file.png[add+file]
+
. Click the *File Endpoint* to open the Properties editor.
. Enter a *Path* where you want Mule to create a file. For example: `/Users/mulesoft/Downloads`
. Enter a *File Name/Pattern* that defines the file name and type, as follows:
+
`#[message.id].txt`
+

. Save your application, then run it again. (Right-click *Basic Tutorial.xml* in your Package Explorer, then click *Run As* > *Mule Application*.)
. Wait for the message in the console that reads, `Started app 'basic_tutorial'`.
. Return to your Web browser and go to `http://localhost:8081/world`
. Replace `world` with another word of your choice and refresh.
. Check your console, using the Find command, for the logged payload and message ID to confirm that Mule has logged both successfully for each message you have initiated using the browser.
. Navigate to the folder on your local drive that you defined in Step 5, above. 
. Your folder should contain .txt files. Open each .txt file and confirm that: 
.. The payload matches what you observed in your browser  
.. The file name corresponds to the message id logged in your console
