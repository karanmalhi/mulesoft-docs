[WARNING]
====
*Running Studio on a Mac?*

If you're using Mac OS X Mountain Lion, there are two extra considerations to be mindful of when running Anypoint Studio.

*Java Runtime Environment*

Check to confirm that Java runtime environment 6 or 7 is in place on your system. From the command line (Terminal app), run: ` java -version`

The response should appear similar to the following:

[source, code, linenums]
----
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_43-b01-447-11M4203)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.14-b01-447, mixed mode)
----

If a Java runtime environment is _not_ installed, the command triggers a prompt to install the JDK tools directly from Apple. Follow the instructions to download and install JDK 6 or 7.

*Application Execution*

By default, Mac OS X restricts execution of applications acquired outside the Apple App Store. Because you download Anypoint Studio _outside_ the App Store, your system may prevent you from running Anypoint Studio applications and issue a warning message advising you to change your security settings to proceed. If you have Administrator privileges, you can adjust the security settings under **System Preferences > Security & Privacy**. However, you can also right-click on the application to bypass the security warning and proceed to open the app.
