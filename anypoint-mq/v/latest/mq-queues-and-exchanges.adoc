= Anypoint MQ Queues and Exchanges
:keywords: mq, destinations, queues, exchanges, client application

Anypoint MQ is a messaging broker that lets applications communicate by publishing a Mule Message to a queue so that another application can consume the message.

This guide describes how to create a queue, exchange, and client application using Anypoint Platform.

== Create a Queue

To create a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.

+
. Click *Destinations*:
+
image:mq-destinations-label.png[mq-destinations-label, width="177"]
+
. Click the blue plus circle.
. Click *Queue*.
+
In the *Create Queue* window:
+
image:mq-create-demo-queue.png[mq-create-demo-queue, width="400"]
+
.. Specify a name.
.. (Optional) Change the time-to-live (TTL) durations for the default message TTL - how long messages persist, and
for the lock TTL - how long messages are locked for applications to have exclusive access to a message.
.. (Optional) Set the queue to encrypted. Anypoint MQ uses PBE with MD5 and DES to encrypt messages.
.. Click *Save Changes*.
. In the Destinations screen, click the queue name to list its details:

The next section describes how Anypoint Platform lets you send
messages to a queue and view, return the messages to the queue, or delete the messages.
Message content (called a payload) can be text, JSON, or CSV (comma-separated values).

=== Send a Message to a Queue

To send a message to a queue:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top task bar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the queue entry in Destinations to view details about
the queue.
. Click the queue name in the details to open the Messaging feature:

+
. Type text in the *Payload* such as `Hello Mules` (leave the *Type* field set to *Text*):
+

+
. Click *Send*.

=== Verify the Message in a Queue

To verify that the message arrived in the queue:

. Click *Destinations*:
+

=== Get a Message From a Queue

To get a message from a queue:

. Follow the directions in <<Send a Message to the Queue>> and
advance to Step 6, except click *Message Browser*:
+
image:mq-click-msg-browser.png[mq-click-msg-browser]
+
. Click *Get Messages*.
+
image:mq-get-messages.png[mq-get-messages]
+
. Click the message ID value to view the message.
+
image:mq-click-id.png[mq-click-id]
+
. If you want to return the message to the queue, such as if other applications may also want to read
the message, click the *Return Messages* icon - this is the default condition. If you switch screens back
to the Message Sender or to Destinations, messages automatically return to the queue.
In Anypoint MQ, returning the messages to the queue is known as `nack` - the message is not altered. However,
the time to live (TTL) value you set when you created your queue determines how long the message is available
before Anypoint MQ deletes it.

+
Alternatively, you can delete the message by clicking the trash can icon. In Anypoint MQ, deleting a message is called an `ack`:

Now you are able to send and receive messages in Anypoint MQ. In the next section, you can try
alternate ways of formatting messages.

=== Send a CSV or JSON Message

To send a JSON message:

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *JSON*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"animal that walks":"dog",
"animal that swims":"fish",
"animal that flies":"parrot"
}
----
+
. Click *Message Browser* and the message ID to view the message:
+

To send a CSV message:

. Click *Message Sender*.
. Set the *Type* to *CSV*.
. Set the *Payload* to:
+
[source,code]

"dog",
"fish",
"parrot"
----
+
. Click *Message Browser* and the message ID to view the message.

=== Send a Message to an Exchange

Sending a message to an exchange is very similar to sending a message to a queue.
The only difference is that you can get the message from any queue bound to an exchange.

To send a message to an exchange:

. Log into link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Anypoint Platform].
. In the top taskbar, click *MQ*.
. Click *Destinations*.
. Click the `MyDemoExchange` entry in Destinations to view details about
the exchange.
. Click the *MyDemoExchange* link in the details screen to access the Message Sender:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-access.png[mq-exchange-msg-access]
+
. Click *Message Sender*:
+
image:mq-exchange-msg-sender.png[mq-exchange-msg-sender]
+
. Type the contents of the *Payload* and click *Send*:
+
image:mq-exchange-payload.png[mq-exchange-payload]

You can now use the Message Browser to get the message from the MyDemoQueue as described
in <<Get a Message From a Queue>>.

You can also send comma-separated value (CSV) or JSON content in the payload by changing
the message *Type* value. For more information, see <<Send a CSV or JSON Message>>.
