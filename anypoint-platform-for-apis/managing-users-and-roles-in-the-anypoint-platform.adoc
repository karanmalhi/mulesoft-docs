= Managing Users and Roles in the Anypoint Platform

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have an Organization Administrator role in your organization, or that you have API Version Owner permissions and want to manage user permissions for your API version.

== Managing Users, Permissions, and Roles

Organization Administrators can manage users and roles on the Organization Administration page.

Individual users who are not Organization Administrators but who have API Version Owner permissions can also grant other users API Version Owner or Portal Viewer permissions. See link:#ManagingUsersandRolesintheAnypointPlatform-incontext[Granting Permissions from the API Version Details Page] below.

== Inviting Users

As an Organization Administrator, you can invite new users and manage existing users for your organization on the Anypoint Platform Organization Administration page, which you can reach by clicking the gear icon in the upper right corner of your screen from anywhere in the platform.

. Click *Users* in the left navigation bar on the Organization Administration page.
. Click *Invite user*.
. Enter the email addresses of who you want to invite in your organization as a comma-separated list.
. Optionally, select one or more link:#ManagingUsersandRolesintheAnypointPlatform-UnderstandingRoles[roles] to which to assign these users.
. Click *Send Invitation*.

The users who you invite receive email invitations to sign up to your organization.

Resend or cancel a sent invitation? Click *Pending Invites* to view all invitations that have not yet been accepted. Select the ones you need to manage, and click *Re-send Invite* or *Cancel Invite*.

== Understanding Permissions

You can assign user permissions to edit or view individual API versions or API portals using the following pre-defined scopes:

* *API Version Owner*: API Version Owners can view specific versions of the API that they own. API Version Owners inherit Portal Viewer permissions by default for any API Portals that you create for the API versions they own.
* *Portal Viewer*: Portal Viewers can see a list of the Private API Portals to which they have Portal Viewer permissions from the Developer Portal. They can also click to view those API Portals. Note that the ability to view an API Portal does not automatically give a user access to the API.

== Granting Permissions to Individual Users

There are two ways to assign permissions. One way is to use the permissions system in the Organization Administration page, which Organization Owners can access by clicking the gear icon at the top right of the page. The other is to assign permissions directly from an API version details page, which you can do as an API Version Owner.

=== Assigning Permissions from Organization Administration Page

. In the Organization Administration page, click *Users* to view a list of your users.
. Search or browse to find a user to whom you wish to grant permissions, then click the username.
. On the user details page, you can edit the user's email address, send a reset password link, or configure API Permissions and Roles. By default, the API Permissions tab is open.
. Click *Add an API resource* to open a search field. Enter part or all of the name of the API to which you wish to grant permissions.
+

. Configure versions and access levels by selecting an API and using the *Select Version* and *Select Access* buttons. Note that you cannot grant Portal Viewer permissions unless the API has an API Portal.
+

. Click the green check mark to commit your selections.

=== Granting Permissions from the API Version Details Page

If you are not an organization owner, you can assign permissions for APIs that you are an API Version Owner.

. Navigate to the API Version Details page of the API and click the *Permissions* tab.
. Search for the user to whom you want to grant permission by name or email. Note that the user must already be a members of your organization for you to grant permissions.
. Select the permission that you wish to grant from the drop-down list. Note that if you have not yet created an API Portal for this API version, the *Portal Viewer* option does not display in the drop-down list.

If necessary, you can remove user permissions. Note that if users have been granted their permission via a role, managed by Organization Administrators on the Organization Administration page, you cannot view or remove those role-based permissions here.

== Understanding Roles

The Anypoint Platform has two *roles* that are automatically configured for all organizations. These roles cannot be changed or deleted. They are:

*Organization Administrators*: Members of the Organization Administrator role have editing access to all versions of all APIs, all registered applications, and all API Portals in the Anypoint Platform. They also have access to the Organization Administration page, where they can add and manage users and roles, view and edit organization details, access the client ID and client secret for the organization, and customize the theme of the Developer Portal. Members of the Organization Administrator role also inherit the role of API Creator by default.

*API Creators*: Members of the API Creator role have the ability to add new APIs to the platform on the API administration page.

The user who first signs up for the Anypoint Platform organization is known as the Organization Owner. This is not a role but an identifier for this single user, who inherits the Organization Administrator role by default.

== Creating Custom Roles

As an organization administrator, you can create custom roles by combining API resources, permissions, and users.

. Click the *Roles* tab in the left navigation of your Organization Administration page.
. Click *Add role*.
. Enter a *Name* and *Description* for your custom role.
. Your custom role now appears in your list of roles. Click the name of your new role to continue.
. On the API Permissions tab, click *Add an API resource* and search for the APIs that you want to include in this role. 
. Select the *Version* and *Permission* that you want to give to this role.
. Commit your choice by clicking the green checkmark.
. Click the *Users* tab. 
. Search for the users that you want to add, one by one, using their name, username, or email address.
. Commit each user using the green check mark.

To edit your custom role at any time, return to your Roles tab, click the name of the role, and add or delete APIs, permissions, or users as needed.

You can delete custom roles within the Organizer Administrator or API Creator roles, but you cannot delete these roles themselves. To delete a custom role, check the box next to the role name, then click *Delete*.

== Federated Organizations - Map Users to Anypoint Platform Roles

As of November 2014, Anypoint Platform provides a feature to help you map users in a federated organization's LDAP groups. This requires that your Anypoint Platform organization utilizes an external identity provider such as   https://www.pingidentity.com/en/products/pingfederate.html[PingFederate].

This feature enables users in an organization to log into Anypoint Platform using the same organizational credentials and access permissions that an organization maintains using LDAP. This ensures credential security and maintains organizational roles for accessing privileged information.

To support this feature:

* link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis-administration/setting-up-external-identity[Configure external identity]
* link:#ManagingUsersandRolesintheAnypointPlatform-verifyinfo[Verify SAML assertion information]
* link:#ManagingUsersandRolesintheAnypointPlatform-configroles[Configure Anypoint Platform Roles with the same values as the SAML assertion]

=== Verify SAML Information

The SAML assertion is an XML file that is issued by the external identity provider as described in link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis-administration/setting-up-external-identity[Setting Up External Identity].

Log into Anypoint Platform and click the *External Identity* tab to verify your organization's Identity management information.

image:managing-users-and-roles-in-the-anypoint-platform-4.png[image]

Verify that the **group_attribute **value is set to the correct attribute name. In the example above, the attribute is named *memberOf*. You can see a sample SAML assertion with that attribute below :

[source,xml]
----
<saml:Attribute NameFormat="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:basic" Name="memberOf">
  <saml:AttributeValue xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="xs:string">cn=jira-users,ou=groups,dc=muleforge,dc=org</saml:AttributeValue>
  <saml:AttributeValue xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="xs:string">cn=confluence-users,ou=groups,dc=muleforge,dc=org</saml:AttributeValue>
  <saml:AttributeValue xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="xs:string">cn=mule-community,ou=groups,dc=muleforge,dc=org</saml:AttributeValue>
  <saml:AttributeValue xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="xs:string">cn=SR-User,ou=Groups,dc=muleforge,dc=org</saml:AttributeValue>
</saml:Attribute>
----

All other information on the tab is provided when registering an organization to use Anypoint Platform. If any information needs to be changed, log into the  https://www.mulesoft.com/support-login[MuleSoft Support Portal] and submit a request.

. Copy the string from your SAML assertion's AttributeValue to the *External group name* field, for example:
+
SAML AttributeValue:
+
[source,xml]
----
<saml:AttributeValue xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:type="xs:string">cn=jira-users,ou=groups,dc=muleforge,dc=org</saml:AttributeValue>
----
