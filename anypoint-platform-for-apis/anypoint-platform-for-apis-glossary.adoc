:keywords: anypoint, glossary, api

=== Analytics Dashboard

The analytics dashboard (anypoint.mulesoft.com/analytics) is made of one or more charts that display metrics for the APIs registered in your organization. Only Organization Administrators have access to the Analytics Dashboard.

=== Applications

Developers register their applications to get access to API versions. Upon registration, an application is assigned a unique client id and client secret, which can be used when required to access APIs protected by an OAuth 2.0 token enforcement policy and/or to access APIs that are protected by a Client ID Enforcement policy or SLA-based rate limiting or throttling policies. An application can be in pending, approved, or revoked state, relative to a specific API version to which access has been requested.

=== API Administration page

Visible only to Organization Administrators, API Creators, and API Version Owners, the API Administration page is an administrative view of the APIs currently registered in the platform. Accessible at anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/admin. From this view, API Creators and Organization Administrators can register new APIs or add new versions to existing APIs, and API Version Owners can access the API version details pages for the specific API versions to which they have been granted API Version Owner permissions.

=== API Creator

A user that has been added to the API Creator role (one of two pre-configured roles in the Anypoint Platform for APIs – the other is Organization Administrator) can add new APIs to the organization. A user who creates an API in the API Administration interface automatically inherits API Version Owner access for that API.

=== API Console

The API Console is automatically generated based on a RAML definition, providing interactive documentation for your API version. You can use the console to browse all the actions the API supports and send test calls to the API to solicit responses. The API Console is available as part of API Designer and APIkit, and, as an API Version Owner, you can expose it directly in an API Portal, which you can create via the API Version Details page.

=== API Designer

The API Designer is the custom environment specifically dedicated to designing and writing an API definition in RAML. The API definition that you create here can be consumed by APIkit to build out your API. You can access the API Designer via the API Version Details page. +

=== APIkit

APIkit is an open-source, declarative toolkit to facilitate REST API implementation based on RAML definitions. APIkit is available in Anypoint Studio.

=== API Notebook

API Notebook (anypoint.mulesoft.com/apinotebook) is an interactive JavaScript programming environment that can embed documentation. The Notebook generates an API client based on a RAML API definition, so authenticated live calls can be made to the server, returning real-time information. The API Notebook is used to define client interactions across one or more APIs, chaining multiple API calls together, which can then be used to document usage of the API(s).

=== API Portal

The portal page for an individual API version (or, optionally, multiple versions). This is the face of your API version, where you interact with developers who want to use your API and publish essential information about it, such as the URI and documentation.

=== API Version Details Page

The API version details page is the administrative home of an API version. Only users who have inherited or been granted API Version Owner permissions for an API version can see the API Version Details page. API version details page provides linked access to API Designer, allows you to create and manage an API Portal, and provides an interface for registering your API endpoint and downloading a proxy for that endpoint, if necessary. This page is where API Version Owners can set up SLA tiers, apply runtime policies, and view and manage applications who have registered to consume that API version. +

=== API Version Owner

A user can inherit or be granted API Version Owner permissions for a specific API version. This permission is inherited by API Creators who create a new API version: they automatically get API Version Owner permissions for this API version. The permission can also be granted by an Organization Administrator or another API Version Owner. +

=== Charts

Analytics charts are individual visualizations of data, configured per specific parameters that you set. For example, number of successful API calls for API A Version 1 during the calendar year 2014.

=== Custom Roles

See Roles**.**

=== Developer Portal

The Developer Portal (anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/<organization>) is the default organization home page for all users who are not Organization Administrators or API Creators. It lists all API versions for which the signed in user has at least Portal Viewer permissions, per the roles of which he or she is a member or the individual permissions that have been assigned. Users can search and browse API Portals on this page, then navigate to a specific API Portal to further explore an API. Anonymous users can also access this page and view any API Portals that have been made Public. +

=== Federated Organization

Organization that has set up federated access to the Anypoint Platform, so that user access to the platform is managed by an external identity provider. A federated organization must log in to the platform using their unique URL. For example: anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts/login/myorganizationname

=== Organization Administration Page

Only Organization Administrators have access to the Organization Administration Page, where they can access or configure organization details and manage users and roles.

=== Organization Administrator

An administrative account holder for an organization. An organization administrator has full access to all API versions and portals in the platform. Organization administrators can also access organization details and manage users and roles. The user that signs up for a trial Anypoint Platform for APIs account is automatically given the organization administrator role.

=== Permissions

Permissions refer to the granting of API Version Owner and/or Portal Viewer access for a specific API version. (Note that API Version Owners inherit Portal Viewer permissions implicitly.) Permissions can be granted by organization administrators, who can either create custom roles and associate users and permissions to those roles or assign individual users permissions directly. Permissions can also be granted by any API Version Owner from the API Version details page. +

=== Policy

Policies allow you to require or restrict behavior of applications making calls to your API. The Anypoint Platform for APIs comes with a set of policies out of the box, or you can request a custom policy for your organization by engaging with MuleSoft services.

=== Portal Viewer

Portal Viewer permissions can be inherited or granted for a specific API Portal. This permission is inherited by default when a user is granted or inherits API Version Owner permissions for an API: all API Version Owners automatically get Portal Viewer permissions for that API version. The permission can also be granted by an Organization Administrator from the Organization Administration page, or by an API Version Owner from the API Version details page.

=== Private API Portal

You can configure an API Portal to be either Public or Private. When an API Portal is private, it is only visible to signed-in users who inherit or are explicitly granted Portal viewer permissions. If you are an API Version Owner for an API and you want to ensure that selected users have access to your Private API Portal, grant these permissions via your API Version details page. +

=== Public API Portal

You can configure an API Portal to be either Public or Private. When an API Portal is public, the existence of the API and the documentation are accessible to any user, even if they are not logged in. This does not mean that the API itself can be called without approval, as this is controlled independently.

=== RAML

RAML stands for RESTful API Modeling Language, and is just that: a language for defining RESTful APIs. Use RAML to design and write your API interface, then import the interface file into Anypoint Studio to build out your API with APIkit.

=== Role

A user can be assigned to one or more roles. The roles determine which access rights the users in that role have. Default roles pre-defined by the API platform are Organization Administrator and API Creator. Any users who are added to an organization that are not part of either these pre-defined roles or any custom roles will be able to see only Public portals. Only organization administrators can manage user roles.

=== SLA Tiers

API Version Owners can configure SLA tiers to limit access to a certain number of API calls per time period. Depending on the policies applied to the API version, these tiers may apply to all calls – regardless of source – or to specific applications who pass a client key with their request. Registered applications can request access to one of the defined SLA tiers. Note that in order to enforce the SLA Tiers (optional), you should apply a Client Id Enforcement policy, which will require applications to pass a client id and client secret along with their API call so that the platform can identify them and rate-limit or throttle them according to their assigned tier.

=== User

Anyone who is invited to an Anypoint Platform for APIs organization is a user. Users who are not given access to any other roles can view only Public API Portals.
