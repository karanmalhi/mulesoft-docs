= Building Your API 
:keywords: api, apikit, raml

In the New Enterprise, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) play a key role in synchronizing and streamlining communication between applications. But elegant, well-designed APIs don't code themselves – building a good API eco-system in an enterprise requires tools, helpful constraints, and guidelines to enforce good design practices and maximize the productivity of time spent coding. A development team with such tools is empowered to *code faster*, *test efficiently*, and provide practical, *useful documentation* for end-users.

Enter RAML and APIkit.

|image:raml.png[raml.png] | *RESTful API Modeling Language (http://raml.org/[RAML])* works to define RESTful APIs. Leveraging YAML and JSON, RAML is exceptionally lightweight, encouraging the organic emergence of elegant API patterns. Use RAML – and its http://raml.org/projects.html[intuitive tooling] – to design and write your API interface, then import the interface file into Studio to build out your API with APIkit. 


|image:apiKit.png[apiKit.png] |The first of its kind, *APIkit* is an *open-source*, declarative toolkit specially created to facilitate REST API implementation. As a simple framework that caters to API-first development, APIkit enforces good API implementation practices. Rather than spending weeks or months building an API, you can use this toolkit to develop, document, and test an API within a few days or even hours.

== Get Started with APIkit

. Study the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/apikit-basic-anatomy[Basic Anatomy of APIkit] to examine the parts that make up the whole.

. Learn by example. Follow the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/apikit-tutorial[APIkit Tutorial] to install APIkit, then build, deploy and test a REST API.

. Access link:http://raml.org/[RAML.org] to learn how to build your API interface using link:https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec[RAML] and its link:http://raml.org/projects.html[intuitive tooling].
