= HTTPS API Proxy Example
:keywords: api, proxy, http, box

This document provides an example of an HTTPS proxy application, which requires some additional configuration steps in the proxy than described in the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api[standard proxy example].

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you're familiar with the concept of link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api[proxying APIs] for the link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis[Anypoint Platform for APIs].

== Example HTTPS Proxy Using the Box API

To demonstrate the basic procedure of creating a proxy application, this document uses the public http://www.apihub.com/box/api/box-api[Box API] as an example REST API to stand in for any REST API that you have that you might want to proxy through your API Gateway. The specific configuration for Box is summarized here, but you need to replace this with the corresponding information for your own RESTful services that you wish to proxy.

To follow along with the steps in this example, you must have a link:https://app.box.com/files[box.com] account, which you can create for free if you don't already have one.

=== Building the Proxy in Studio

Next, use the Anypoint Platform to auto-generate a proxy application that will:

. Accept incoming service calls from applications and route them to the Box API.
. Copy any message headers from the service call and pass them along to the Box API.
. Disable the default status code exception check to allow any error messages that the Box API returns to be passed on to the application. 
. Capture message headers from the Box API's response and attach them to the response message.
. Route the response to the application that made the service call.

Follow the instructions below to build the proxy application:

. Go to the API version page of your API on the Anypoint Platform, and configure your endpoint as shown below:

. Click Save & Deploy to have your proxy automatically deployed to CloudHub
. You will be prompted to assign a name to your deployment, which will take the from of <appname>.cloudhub.io
The proxy now points to box, and sends HTTPS requests to it. These HTTPS requests use your default JMV HTTPS certificate. For this example, no further editing of the proxy will be needed, if you do want to add your own certificates then you must link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api[download and modify] the proxy.

[NOTE]

Ideally, because this API requires HTTPS, all connections to and from the proxy application run over HTTPS rather than HTTP. However, for the purposes of this example, the HTTP listener connector for the proxy is reached through 0.0.0.0 on your computer, which is not certified as a secure server, and thus this listener connection does not work reliably through HTTPS.

If you wish to use HTTPS for the HTTP listener of your API proxy, your web server must have a *public key certificate*, signed by a *trusted certificate authority*. Once you have that, you can set this HTTP listener to HTTPS by following the steps in link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api[Proxying Your API].

*Note*: If you use the default certificates from your JMV, you must include a host name and IP address. 

=== Registering an App in the Box Developer Portal

The steps below are only needed in this particular example so that you can test your finished proxy for the Box API by simulating an API call from an application. They don't necessarily match the steps you need to carry out to test your own API.

. Go to Box's developer portal: http://developers.box.com/[developers.box.com], and log in to your box account
. Click *Create a Box Application*
. You are then prompted to provide a name for your application. Give it any name, such as `MyProxy`, then select the *Content API*. If this is your first Box app, you are prompted to upgrade your Box account to a Developer account.
. Click *Configure Application*.
. Click *Create a Developer Token* and copy the Developer Token code that is displayed there

=== Testing the Proxy Example

Send a request to the URL that you assigned to your proxy by simulating an API call from an application. This request will return the contents inside your Box account.

[TIP]
You can use a browser extension such as  link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm[Postman]  (Google Chrome), or the  http://curl.haxx.se/[curl]  command line utility

This request must be configured in the following way:

. The URL must be to a specific path inside the URL that you assigned to your proxy
+
[source,code,linenums]
----
<appname>.cloudhub.io/api/2.0/folders/0 
----
+
[WARNING]
Replace <appname> in the URL above with the name you assigned to your API when deploying it to CloudHub.

. Include an authorization header on every request as a header with the name `authorization`.
+
[WARNING]
The value of the header must include the word *Bearer* followed by a space and then the access_token. For example:

[source,code,linenums]
----
Authorization=Bearer 1234123412341234
----


[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header"]
|===
|Header |Value
|authorization |Bearer <access_token>
|===
