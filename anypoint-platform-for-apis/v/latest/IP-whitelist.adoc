:keywords: IP, whitelist, validation, policy

This page describes the configuration and runtime application instructions for the IP whitelist policy for the Anypoint Platform for APIs.
The IP Whitelist policy allows you to control wether a list or range of IP addresses can access and interact with your configured API endpoint.

== Prerequisites
This document assumes that you are an API Version Owner for the API version that you want to manage, or that you are an Organization Administrator.

==  Whitelisting IP addresses to access your API endpoint
There are currently two options to whitelist addresses for your API:

. <<Option 1: Whitelist access based on the IP address of the request>>
. <<Option 2: Whitelist access based on the origin IP address of the x-Forwarded-For header>>

=== Option 1: Whitelist access based on the IP address of the request
You can choose to whitelist a list of IP addresses by specifying them in the white space under the Whitelist section of the form:

image:ip+whitelist.png[ip+whitelist]

All addresses defined there will be whitelisted to access and interact with your API.

There are three ways you can specify an address or a range or addresses:

. Define a specific IP address by simply enumerating it in the white space (e.g. 192.168.1.1).
. Define a subset of addresses by identifying a subnet mask (e.g. 192.168.3.1/30 will include the consolidated range: 192.168.3.0 - 192.168.3.3).
. Define a whole range of IP addresses by simply stating the relevant octets of the IP address you want to permit (e.g. setting "192.168" will include IP addresses from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255).


=== Option 2: Whitelist access based on the origin IP address of the x-Forwarded-For header
If your client is connecting to your API through an HTTP proxy or a load-balancer, you might want to whitelist your client's specific IP (i.e. the IP originating the request) instead of the address that will appear in the request.
For example:
If you are interested in whitelisting 192.168.2.3 and this client is connecting through an HTTP proxy whose address is 92.40.1.255, their request will show up with this public address.
In order to go around this, applications use the 'X-Forwarded-For' header to identify the origin IP addresses of a request that was redirected to your endpoint.

You can use a Mule expression to instruct the service to look for the IP address in the 'x-Forwarded-For' header:

[source, EML]
----
#[message.inboundProperties['http.headers']['X-Forwarded-For']]
----

And insert it in the IP expression field:

image:ip+whitelist+ip_expression.png[ip+whitelist+ip_expression]

This will instruct API Platform to look at the first IP address that ranks in the concatenated values of the 'x-Forwarded-For' header of the request.
