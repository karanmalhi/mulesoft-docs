= Images and Attachments in API Portal
:keywords: api, portal, images

API Portal allows you to upload attachments and images for display within API Portal itself. This makes it easy to document or publish important information about your API.

API Portal displays images that you upload or link to, and lists attached files which users of your API can download. Images and attachments that you upload to API Portal are removed if you delete the API Portal where you uploaded them.

== Images

=== Supported Image Types

You can upload or link to the following types of images:

* PNG
* JPEG
* SVG
* GIF
* WEBP
* BMP

You cannot upload images larger than 5 MB. If your image is larger, you can host it on an external site and link to it from within API Portal.

=== Uploading or Linking to Images

==== Uploading

Images you upload to your portal are displayed in the portal itself.

To include an image in API Portal, click the image icon outlined below.

When you click the image icon, API portal displays the image uploading/linking controls:

As you can see, to include an image in API Portal you can either:

* Drag-and-drop an image from your filesystem browser to API Portal ("dropping" it anywhere in the gray area); or
* Choose an image to upload

You can also link to an image hosted on an external site, as detailed below.

==== Linking

API Portal's image link functionality allows you to link to an image hosted on an external site. API Portal displays linked images just like uploaded images. You can link to images of any of the supported link:#ImagesandAttachmentsinAPIPortal-types[images types], of any size.

To link to an image, you must use an absolute URL, including protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and full path, such as `http://example.com/my_image.png`.

[NOTE]
====
If you link to an image, API Portal displays the image but does not store it. If the real image is deleted (i.e. deleted from the external host), the image will cease to be available on API Portal.

Click the Trash icon, then click *Delete* to confirm the operation.

== Constraints for Images and Attachments

*Max. size:* 5 MB. Images and attachments that you upload to API Portal cannot exceed this size. If your image exceeds this size, you can host it on an external site and link to it from within API Portal.

*Linking:* You can link to images hosted on external sites, but not to other file types. The link function is not available for attachments.

*Exporting:* Currently, exporting your API does not include images or attachments. If you attempt to export an API that contains images or attachments, you will get a reminder message during the export.
