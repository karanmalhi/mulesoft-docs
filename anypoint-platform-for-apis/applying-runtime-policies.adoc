= Applying Runtime Policies
:keywords: policy, endpoint

This page covers how to apply and unapply governance policies to your API version at runtime.

== Assumptions

This page assumes that you have API Version Owner permissions for the API version that you are trying to manage. You must link:/docs/display/current/Setting+Your+API+URL[have an endpoint declared] for your API version before you can apply policies.

[WARNING]
Note that policies can only be enforced by the Anypoint Platform for endpoints that are registered on an link:/docs/display/current/Configuring+an+API+Gateway[API Gateway]. Thus, while you can apply and unapply policies at any time after link:/docs/display/current/Setting+Your+API+URL[setting your API URL], you must link:/docs/display/current/Deploying+Your+API+or+Proxy[deploy your API or a proxy application to your API Gateway] before those policies can be enforced.

== Available Policies 

[NOTE]
Note that all the policy templates below are intended only for HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. If your API uses a Jetty inbound endpoint, all policies below will function as expected except for the rate-limiting and throttling policies. These policies will not work due to a limitation of the Jetty transport. If your API requires rate-limiting or throttling, please ensure that its inbound endpoint uses the HTTP transport protocol.

The Anypoint Platform for APIs includes the following out-of-the-box policy templates.

== Applying and Removing Policies

After you have declared an endpoint for your API version, the three management tabs on your API version details page become active: Applications, Policies, and SLA Tiers.

To apply a policy to your endpoint:

. Click *Policies* to view the list of available policies for your organization. 
. Select individual policies to read their descriptions. When you have found the one you want to apply, click *Apply.*
. Depending on the policy that you have selected, you may need to provide further configuration. See detailed instructions for configuring one of the available policies:

 ** link:/docs/display/current/LDAP+Security+Manager[LDAP policy]
** link:/docs/display/current/OAuth+2.0+Provider+and+OAuth+2.0+Token+Enforcement+Policies[AES-based OAuth policy set]
** link:/docs/display/current/PingFederate+OAuth+Token+Enforcement+Policy[PingFederate Policy]
** link:/docs/display/current/OpenAM+OAuth+Token+Enforcement+Policy[OpenAM Policy]

If the policy that you wish to apply has a disabled *Apply* link, it is not eligible to be applied to your endpoint. Either:

* you already have another policy applied which fulfills the same requirement (see the Fulfills column) +
or
* the policy that you want to apply requires that another policy be applied first (see the Requires column)

To unapply policies, click *Remove*. The policies are immediately removed from your endpoint. Note that if you wish to reapply the policy, you need to configure it again. Your previous configuration is not saved.
