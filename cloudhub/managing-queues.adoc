= Managing Queues
:keywords: cloudhub, managing, monitoring, seda, vm

CloudHub includes a *Queues* tab in the left navigation menu where you can view and control any Virtual Machine (VM) or Staged Event-Driven Architecture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staged_event-driven_architecture[SEDA]) queues within the flows of your deployed applications:

CloudHub automatically detects the queues from within your flow and lists them on the Queues tab. You can see the number of queued and in-flight messages on each queue, view a snapshot of the queue throughput for the past 24 hours, or clear all pending messages on a queue – all during runtime, without making any changes in the underlying application. You can also enable data-at-rest encryption for your persistent queues, this ensures that any shared application data written out to a persistent queue is encrypted.

== Use Cases

The Queues tab is especially useful for the following use cases:

* You want runtime visibility into the queues in your application.
* You are testing your application to observe whether messages are traveling through your queues as expected.
* Your application is stuck processing a particular message and you want to flush the messages from just that queue to resolve the issue.

== Enabling Queues

To enable queues:

.  Deploy an application to CloudHub that includes one or more link:/docs/display/current/VM+Transport+Reference[VM endpoints] or that includes a flow set to the queued-asynchronous link:/docs/display/current/Flow+Processing+Strategies[processing strategy]. 
.  In CloudHub, click the application and click *Manage Application*.
.  Click the checkbox for *Persistent queues*.
.  If you are enabling this setting when deploying an application, click *Deploy Application*. If you are updating an existing application, click *Apply Changes*.

== Viewing Queues

After you enable Persistent queues, click *Queues* in the left navigation menu. CloudHub lists the queues in your application in the order that they appear in your application:

The name of each queue is determined by the `path` attribute of the associated VM endpoint, or, in the case of a SEDA queue, from the flow name.

The *Queued* column shows the number of messages currently waiting on each of the queues in your application. The *In-Flight* column indicates the number of messages being processed in the flow after that queue. The in-flight messages are technically still on the queue until processing is complete – only then are they deleted from the queue. The *Processed Messages* column shows a thumbnail graph depicting the number of messages processed through each queue over the past 24 hours. The Queued and In-Flight columns update every five seconds, and the Processed Messages graph updates every five minutes.

== Clearing Queues

To clear one or more queues, click one or more checkboxes next to the queues you want to clear, and click *Clear*.

CloudHub presents a warning message that confirms which queues to clear and the duration this process takes to occur. Click *Clear Queues* to proceed.

After you confirm, the queues that you selected display a "Clearing queue in progress" message until the clearing process is complete:

Clearing a queue flushes all messages waiting in the queue and all in-flight messages. After the queue clearing process is complete, the queue immediately begins accepting messages again.

== Encrypting Data at Rest in Persistent Queues

You can enable data-at-rest encryption for all your persistent queues. By enabling this feature, you ensure that any shared application data written out to a persistent queue is encrypted, allowing you to meet your security and compliance needs.

[IMPORTANT]
Note that if you enable encryption and then disable it, any messages that were previously encrypted remain like that and become unreadable.

== Limitations

When enabling persistent queues in your application, be aware of the following:

* Persistent queues do not guarantee one-time-only message delivery. Duplicate messages may be sent. If one-time-only message delivery is critical for your use case, do not enable persistent queues.
* If you clear a queue using the Queues tab in the console, any new messages sent to the queue during the queue clearing process may be lost.
* Enabling persistent queues has a performance implication: Putting a small message (50kb or less) on a queue can take 10-20 milliseconds (ms); taking the same message off a queue can take 70-100ms.
