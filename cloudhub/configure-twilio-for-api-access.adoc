:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, api, twilio

Twilio is a cloud communications Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). It provides an API for making and receiving telephone calls, and sending and receiving text messages. To get started with Twilio, follow the steps below to gain access to their free sandbox service to send SMS text-messages. You can then configure the Twilio connector in Mule Studio with your API credentials.

== Create a New Twilio Account

. To create a new Twilio account, go to https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio and register under "Try Twillio Free".

== Obtain API Credentials

. Once you login to your developer account, you see the Twilio dashboard. Note the *Account SID* and *Auth Token* values provided. You will need to copy these credentials into the Twilio connector configuration menu in Mule Studio.

== Verify a SMS-Enabled Phone

. With a free developer account, you need to verify your SMS-enabled phone before you can send text messages to it.
. Click on *Numbers* in the Twilio website navigation to go to the Manage Numbers portion of their website.
. Click on *Verify Numbers*, and then click on *Verify a number*. A new window will open as shown below.

. Enter your cell phone number, and click on *Call this number*. Follow their instructions provided to validate your number. You  receive an automated phone call and need to enter an authorization code.
. Finally, to send SMS-messages, you  need to use the Sandbox "from" number. This phone number needs to be entered into the Twilio connector configuration menu in Mule Studio. This Sandbox number is also located on the Twilio dashboard, along with the Account SID and Auth Token.

[TIP]
As you copy fields from the Twilio website to the Mule Studio connector configuration, be sure that you do not copy in additional leading/trailing characters or spaces. It is a good idea to visually confirm that your copy and paste functions did not capture surrounding characters.
