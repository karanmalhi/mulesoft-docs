:keywords: b2b, edi, x12, order, processing, example

This example shows how to process an X12 850 document, export data to a CSV file, and generate a 997 acknowledgement using the File endpoint, link:/anypoint-b2b/x12-module[X12 Module], link:/docs/current/Batch+Processing[Batch Processing] module, and link:/docs/current/Datamapper+User+Guide+and+Reference[DataMapper]. 

== Prerequisites

Before going further, link:https://www.mulesoft.com/ty/dl/studio[install Anypoint Studio], the EDI Module in Anypoint Studio, and be familiar with the basic concepts of Mule applications.

== Concepts

The example application is comprised of 2 flows and 1 batch process. These do the following:

* ReceiveOrdersFromPartner: reads in an EDI file, validates it, send it off for processing and triggers sending of the acknowledgement
* Process850s: This batch job processes each record and outputs them to a CSV file with the item id, quantity and price.
* SendAck: Send a 997 acknowelgement generated from the first flow.

. Right click on the "Read EDI Doc" message processor and click "Add X12 EDI libraries to project"
. Right click on the imported project folder, "x12-850-processing", select Run As, and click Mule Application.
. Inside the project is a file in src/test/resources called "walmart.edi". Create a copy and place it in the "input" folder.
. After a few seconds, two files are created in the output directory. "ack.edi" which contains the 997 acknowledgement and the "export.csv" file which contains the exported items from the 850.
