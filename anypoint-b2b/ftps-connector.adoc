== Installing and Configuring

=== Installing the FTPS Connector in Anypoint Studio

Follow the steps below to install the FTPS Connector in Anypoint Studio. To use the FTPS Connector connector in a production environment, you must have purchased a license for Anypoint B2B.

. Under the *Help* menu in *Anypoint Studio*, select *Install New Software*. 
. Click Add to add the B2B beta update site
. Type in "ModusBox Inc" in the *Name* field and http://modusbox.com/b2b-update-site/ in the *Location* field
. Select Add
. In the table below the  *Filter*  field, click to expand the  *Premium*  folder, then select  `FTPS Connector` . Click  *Next* . 
. Review the details of the item you selected, then click *Next*.
. Click to accept terms and conditions of the product, then click *Finish*.
. Click *Restart Now* to complete the installation. After you install the connector and restart Studio you can see several new message processors available in the palette, under the Connectors category.

=== Using the FTPS Module via Maven

If you wish to use the FTPS Module in conjunction with Maven, please follow the instructions http://modusintegration.github.io/mule-connector-ftps/[here].

=== Configuring

In order to order to configure the FTPS connector , you must first know your endpoint configuration needs. See the Hello World application below for a configuration example.

=== Updating From an Older Version

This is currently the first version of the connector.

== Using This Connector

=== Use Cases

* Read file(s) over FTPS, alternatively using a wildcard pattern
* Write file over FTPS
* Transfer files using Active and Passive FTP modes
* Transfer files using Explicit and Implicit SSL modes

=== Tips

* Use passive mode whenever possible. It is easier to set up from the client’s perspective.
* Polling the server is possible from the FTPS connector itself; there’s no need to use a Poll component. This is useful when waiting for a given file to be published by others.
* The FTPS Connector supports compression out-of-the-box. If your FTP server supports deflate mode (a.k.a “mode z”), the FTPS Connector will detect this feature and enter compression mode for you.

== Example Use Case - Hello World

The following examples explain the FTPS Connector configuration options for sending and receiving files.

You'll learn how to

* Receive a file over FTPS
* Write a file on the server over FTPS
* Receive one or more files over FTPS filtering by wildcard pattern

=== Read a file over FTPS

In this example, the connector will read a file over FTPS and save its contents locally.

*Step 1* +
Create a new Mule Project using as run-time Mule Server 3.6.0 EE:

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image01.png?version=1&modificationDate=1427580589518[image]

*Step 2* +
Locate the FTPS Connector on the right hand-side palette:

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image08.png?version=1&modificationDate=1427580590487[image]

*Step 3* +
Drag and drop the FTPS connector over to the canvas:

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image02.png?version=1&modificationDate=1427580589683[image]

*Step 4* +
Create a connector configuration for the FTPS element

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image10.png?version=1&modificationDate=1427580590751[image] +

*Step 5* +
Set the FTPS settings according to your scenario. In this example, we have an FTPS server running on localhost.

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image_4.png?version=2&modificationDate=1438078515712[image]

. *B2B settings* +
Activate this option if the Global configuration options are being set using a B2B Provider. +
. *Connection settings* +
Set the host of your FTP server, this can be an IP address or a host name. Set the port the FTP server is listening to (control channel). Set whether you prefer active or passive connection modes. Fill in the blanks in the _Advanced_ tab if you go for active. If you want to use explicit mode, select EXPLICIT in the _Encryption mode_ field. The _Streaming_ option is suitable for large files; instead of reading the contents to a byte array in memory; an input stream will be passed as payload to the next component in the flow. +
. *Security - FTP* +
Your username and password on the FTP server.
+
Advanced settings can also be applied if needed. Read below for a brief description for each.
+
image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image_4.1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1438078817970[image]


. *Security - Certificates* (Optional) +
If set, the FTPS connector will validate your server’s identity with these certs. Only JKS format is supported at the moment. _If you want to disable server certificate validation, you’ll be able to find that option in this section as well, although it’s not recommended.
 
. *Active Mode settings* +
These fields are going to be read in case _ACTIVE_ was selected as _Transfer Mode_. The _Reported IP Address_ is the external IP address to use if your application runs within a LAN and the FTP server is external to it.
. *Pre-processing* +
The _Upload temp directory_ sets the location on the *server side* where the files are going to be uploaded before they reach they final destination.
.  *Concurrent downloads* +
The number of worker threads to use when downloading multiple files (useful when reading files using a wildcard pattern or a directory).

*Step 6*  

Now let’s set up the connector’s Read File operation to retrieve a file securely from the FTP Server. File contents will be passed to the next processor in the flow.

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image_5.png?version=1&modificationDate=1435270706829[image]

. *Basic Settings*  +
Select the _Read_ operation
. *General Options*  +
Enter the path and filename of the file you aim to read from the server. In our case we’re transferring _modus-test-read.txt_ which is located at the _/demo_ directory of the FTP user we’ve set.
. **Post-processing**  +
After a file has been read, the connector will attempt to delete it from the server unless _Move to Directory_ is set to an existing location on the server. This field is optional.
. *Polling*  +
The connector polls the server for the specified file. By default it checks for the file every second. Once it gets it it will continue to read the file and inject it into the flow.
. *B2B options*  +
The specification ID for inbound transactions set on the B2B platform. This field is required if the _Use B2B Provider_ was checked in the global configuration.

 
*Step 7* +
Now it’s up to you to decide what to do with the contents you’ve just read. In this example, we’re going to write the contents to a file. The FTPS connector can help us with that as it gives us 2 extra bits of information: the original filename and its size.

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image03.png?version=1&modificationDate=1427580589791[image]

You should have your application ready to read a file securely from a FTP server you trust.

*Step 8* +
Finally, run the example as a Mule application:

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image05.png?version=1&modificationDate=1427580590066[image]

If the file exists on the remote FTP server, the Connector should read it and locate it under the /tmp folder as setup in Step 7.

=== Write a file on the server over FTPS

This example will write a file over FTPS using the contents received in the payload.

*Steps 1 - 5* +
Follow steps 1-5 in the above example.

*Step 6* +
Drag and drop the File message source into the canvas. Set it up to read any given file in your filesystem.

*Step 7* +
Drag and drop the FTPS connector icon over the canvas, next to the File message source. This is how it should look like:

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image07.png?version=1&modificationDate=1427580590369[image]

*Step 8* +
Now let us set up the FTPS write file operation.

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image_9.png?version=1&modificationDate=1435270912388[image]

As you can see, we’re reusing the Global Configuration element from the previous example. Review *Step 5* of the previous example for further details.

. *General options*  +
As in the Read operation you can select which path to upload your file to. Under Filename you can enter any MEL expression you want; we’re setting a fixed name for simplicity.
. *B2B options*  +
The specification ID for outbound transactions set on the B2B platform. This field is required if the Use B2B Provider was checked in the global configuration.

*Step 9* +
Save your changes and run the application. The application will write your file to the FTPS server under the name specified in the configuration.

=== Receive one or more files over FTPS filtering by a wildcard pattern

This example will receive one or more files over FTPS filtering by a wildcard pattern.

*Steps 1 - 5* +
Same as in the previous example.

*Step 6*

Now let us setup the connector’s Read File using Pattern operation to retrieve a set of files securely from the FTPS server. Every time a file matches the pattern, the set up flow will be activated with the contents of the file.

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image_10.png?version=1&modificationDate=1435270980291[image]

Enter the path of the parent directory you aim to read the files from on the server.

Enter the File pattern as well; bear in mind this is a wildcard pattern. In our case we’re transferring every file that starts with “modusbox-”.

*Step 7*

Let us see an example of how to use the files we have just read. Drag and drop a File connector and set it up as follows:

image:/docs/download/attachments/125305047/image03.png?version=1&modificationDate=1427580589791[image]

The above screenshot shows that the files are saved in our local /tmp directory. Take a look at the File Name/Pattern configuration value. The fileName inbound property is added by the FTPS connector along with the fileSize property. These values can come in handy for when you need to deal with multiple files.

*Step 8* +
Save your changes and run the application. The application will read files from the server matching the filename pattern and save them locally under the same filename they had on the server.
