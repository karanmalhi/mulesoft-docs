= HL7 Global Connector

You can create and configure an HL7 Connector as a [Global Element] which the connectors in your flow will reference. an HL7 connector configured as a global element defines connection parameters for all HL7 connections that reference the connector.

[TIP]
The HL7 connector is part of the [Mule Healthcare Toolkit], which also includes transformers and components for receiving, processing, and sending HL7 messages. For details and a full list of available tools, consult the Toolkit's [documentation main page].

== Configuration

To create an HL7 global connector, complete the following steps:

. Click the *Global Elements* tab under the canvas, then click *Create*.

. At the *Choose Global Type* window, type `h17` into the *Filter* input field to display only HL-7 related global types.

. Under *Connectors*, click *HL7 Connector*, then click *OK*.

Studio displays the *Global Element Properties* window, where you configure the global connector.

The following subsections describe the connector's configuration parameters for configuration in Studio and Mule ESB.

|*Keep Send Socket Open* (boolean) |Do not close a socket after sending a message. |`keepSendSocketOpen="true"`
|*Keep Alive* (boolean) |Enable `SO_KEEPALIVE` on open sockets. This causes a probe packet to be sent on an open socket which has not registered activity for a long period of time, in order to check whether the remote peer is up. |`keepAlive="true"`
|*Client SO_TIMEOUT* |Set the `SO_TIMEOUT` value for client sockets (in milliseconds). This is the timeout for waiting for data. A value of `0` means forever. |`clientSoTimeout="10000"`

|*Socket SO_LINGE* |Set the `SO_LINGER` value for sockets (in milliseconds). This is the value of the delay before closing a socket. If enabled, a call to close the socket before data transmission has finished will block the calling program; the block remains in place until data transmission is finished or until the connection times out. |`socketSoLinger="0"`
