The *Mule Healthcare Toolkit* is a collection of features that facilitates integration with healthcare systems by providing the tools needed to easily create, read, and transform HL7 messages within Mule.

[NOTE]
This document assumes a working knowledge of Mule ESB and Anypoint Studio. To find out more about these applications, consult the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6[Mule User Guide].


== Overview

http://www.hl7.org[Health Level Seven International] is a standards development organization that has defined a set of standards for the transport and communication of healthcare information. 

The connector currently supports the following versions of HL7: *v2.1*, *v2.2*, *v2.3.1*, *v2.3*, *v2.4, v2.5.1, v2.5, v2.6.* Versions 2.7 and 2.8 are not currently supported.

The Mule Healthcare toolkit supports, and allows transformation between, the following message types:

* HL7 ER7: A human-readable format based on line segments and pipe delimiters
* HL7 XML: An XML representation of HL7 ER7 messages
* HAPI Message Objects: The native message format of the http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/[HAPI] (HL7 Application Programming Interface) message parser. HAPI is an open source object-oriented parser that works with HL7 XML (version 2.X) and ER7 formats.

The Mule Healthcare toolkit allows you to send and receive HL7 messages over MLLP (using the link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-endpoint-reference[HL7 connector]) and other transport protocols (and corresponding connectors) supported by Mule, such as link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/http-connector[HTTP].

Other features:

* link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-message-validation[HL7 Message Validation], which you can apply at a global connector level or for specific message processors only
* link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-mule-expression-language-support[HL7 Mule Expression Language Support] allows you to access and modify the contents of an HL7 message using the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/mule-expression-language-mel[Mule Expression Language MEL]

This page describes the functionality included in the Mulesoft Healthcare toolkit, and provides installation instructions.

|Components
|link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-message-component[HL7 Message Component]
|N/A
|HL7 ER7
|Use to generate an ER7-encoded HL7 message with user-defined parameters. Please note that this component does not generate the HL7 _payload_ of a message, only the message structure. Use the link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-append-segment-component-reference[Append Segment Component] to add the payload.

||link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-ack-component-reference[HL7 ACK Component Reference]
|HL7 ER7
|HL7 ER7
|Use to return ACK (general acknowledge) messages to confirm message receipt and validation, and NACK (negative general acknowledge) in case of message errors.

|HAPI Message Object
|HAPI Message Object
|Use in conjunction with the link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-message-component[HL7 Message Component] to add content to an HL7 message.

||link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-delete-segment-component-reference[HL7 Delete Segment Component Reference]
|HAPI Message Object
|HAPI Message Object
|Use to delete content from an HL7 message.

|Transformer

|Filter
|link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-profile-validator-filter[HL7 Profile Validator Filter]
|N/A
|N/A
|Use to conform a message to http://wiki.hl7.org/index.php?title=Conformance_Profile[message profiles], which define constraints that go beyond the standard HL7 specifications.

|Exception Strategy
|link:/mule-healthcare-toolkit/v/3.6/hl7-exception-strategy[HL7 Exception Strategy]
|N/A
|N/A
|Sets a flow's link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/error-handling[exception strategy] to HL7, instead of the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.6/error-handling[default], and sends an (N)ACK message to the originating application.
